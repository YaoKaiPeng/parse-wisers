Feed</p><p>NYTFEED</p><p>英文</p><p>Copyright 2020. The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved. </p><p></p><p>Increasingly, the demonstrations are a direct challenge to China’s ruling Communist Party rather than to the territory’s leadership.</p><p></p><p>The protests in Hong Kong <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/24/world/asia/hong-kong-protest-coronavirus-china.html">this past week</a> have many of the hallmarks of the antigovernment demonstrations last year that came to define the territory’s biggest political crisis in decades. Protesters have tried to target the legislative chambers. They have marched on the streets and waved banners. They have tried to stop traffic.</p><p></p><p>This year, there is a key difference. The protests are increasingly a direct challenge to China’s ruling Communist Party rather than to the territory’s leadership.</p><p></p><p>This latest round of demonstrations, the city’s biggest rallies in months, has been fueled largely by the party’s move this month to impose <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/24/world/asia/hong-kong-protest-coronavirus-china.html">new national security legislation</a> for Hong Kong.</p><p></p><p>To China, the rules are necessary to protect the country’s national sovereignty. To critics, they further erode the relative autonomy granted to the territory after Britain handed it back to China in 1997.</p><p></p><p>Here’s a guide to the protests, and why they have returned.</p><p></p><p>The national security legislation targets dissent.</p><p></p><p>The rules would take direct aim at the antigovernment protests and other dissent in Hong Kong.</p><p></p><p>They are expected to prevent and punish secession, subversion as well as foreign infiltration — all of which Beijing has blamed for fueling unrest in the city. The legislation would also allow the mainland’s feared security agencies to set up their operations publicly in Hong Kong for the first time, instead of operating on a limited scale in secrecy.</p><p></p><p>The legislation has evoked fear that the Communist Party is undermining the freedoms that Hong Kong has enjoyed since China reclaimed the region from Britain. The political framework in Hong Kong, known as “one country, two systems,” ensures the right to assembly and an independent judiciary.</p><p></p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/01/world/asia/hong-kong-china-handover.html?module=inline">China promised that this policy would remain in place</a> until at least 2047.</p><p></p><p>Many protesters believe that Beijing is already <a href="https://sinosphere.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/06/11/beijings-white-paper-sets-off-a-firestorm-in-hong-kong/">eroding the city’s autonomy</a>, and that the local government acts at its behest. The city’s top leader, Chief Executive Carrie Lam, is appointed by a pro-Beijing committee.</p><p></p><p>Beijing hinted at taking a harder line for months.</p><p></p><p>Hong Kong’s mini Constitution, the Basic Law, requires the territory to introduce national security legislation. But the government had not dared to do so after an earlier attempt was stymied in 2003 by huge protests.</p><p></p><p>Now, Beijing is bypassing the Hong Kong government, and the legislation is instead being pushed by China’s rubber-stamp legislature, the National People’s Congress.</p><p></p><p>But Beijing had been signaling for months that it would move against the intensifying protests.</p><p></p><p>A Chinese Communist Party leadership meeting <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/31/world/asia/hong-kong-protests-china.html">in late October called for steps</a> to “safeguard national security” in Hong Kong, without releasing further details. In January, Beijing abruptly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/04/world/asia/china-hong-kong-wang-zhimin.html">replaced its top representative</a> in Hong Kong, installing a senior Communist Party official with a record of working closely with the security services.</p><p></p><p>The national security legislation drew <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/22/world/asia/trump-pompeo-china-hong-kong.html">immediate criticism</a> from the United States.</p><p></p><p>Secretary of State Mike Pompeo warned that the Trump administration could revoke Hong Kong’s status as a separate economic entity from mainland China, an important underpinning of the territory’s easy trade access to the United States. And President Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2020/05/26/us/politics/26reuters-hongkong-protests-usa-china.html">said on Tuesday</a> that he was preparing to take action against China in response to the national security laws on Hong Kong, but did not give details.</p><p></p><p>Peaceful rallies morphed into a broader protest movement.</p><p></p><p>The mass antigovernment protests started nearly a year ago over contentious legislation in Hong Kong that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China. After months of protests, the bill was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/04/world/asia/hong-kong-carrie-lam-protests.html">withdrawn</a> in September.</p><p></p><p>Since then, the demonstrations have morphed into a broader movement calling for increased democracy, an investigation into police brutality and greater autonomy from mainland China. At its core, the movement is aimed at protecting Hong Kong’s autonomy and resisting encroachment from the mainland.</p><p></p><p>What began as peaceful mass rallies in the streets later devolved into intense and often-violent, drawn-out clashes between some protesters and police officers. The most intense of clashes at times transformed large swaths of the global financial hub into fiery urban battlegrounds.</p><p></p><p>All sides appeared ready for a protracted fight until pro-democracy candidates <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/24/world/asia/hong-kong-election-results.html">notched a stunning victory</a> in Hong Kong elections in November, in what was seen as a pointed rebuke of Beijing and its allies in Hong Kong.</p><p></p><p>The protests then quietened. For the first few months of this year, fears of the new <strong>coronavirus</strong> and social distancing orders kept demonstrators indoors.</p><p></p><p>The <strong>coronavirus</strong> pandemic has affected the protests.</p><p></p><p>The emergence of a mysterious virus in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in late December immediately prompted concerns in Hong Kong.

New York Times</p><p>INHT</p><p>英文</p><p>© 2020 The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved. </p><p></p><p>The cast and crew of “Wolf Play” were on their third day of tech rehearsals at Soho Rep in Manhattan in mid-March. “We were doing this complicated boxing scene, and we had the smog machine and the costumes, and it looked awesome,” said Hansol Jung, who wrote the play.</p><p></p><p>It was just days before the opening, and as the scene ended, the company’s three artistic directors came in and announced the production was closing. “They were crying as they told us,” Jung said. “It felt so weird saying goodbye to something that didn’t yet exist.”</p><p></p><p>Jung’s “<a href="https://sohorep.org/wolf-play">Wolf Play</a>”was one of nine productions of works by playwrights of Asian descent that were cut short or canceled in New York City this spring because of <strong>Covid-19</strong>. Just as these playwrights were finally ascendant in downtown theater, the pandemic not only aborted their moment but unleashed <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/23/us/chinese-coronavirus-racist-attacks.html">a wave of \b anti-Asian\b0  discrimination</a> across the country.</p><p></p><p>As a Korean-American poet and essayist, I have witnessed a thrilling renaissance of Asian-American literature in the last few years that has kicked aside conventional tales in favor of stranger, more uncharted narratives. When I began writing in the early 2000s, the publishing industry mostly seemed to look at Asian stories as if they were testimonials of tragic immigrant lives. We were condescended to or treated like content farms.</p><p></p><p>Now I’m reading books by Asian-American authors that are as varied in style as much as content, and I was eager to see how this experimentation has spread to theater. But because of <strong>Covid-19</strong>, I didn’t have a chance to see any of these productions. I had to make do with their scripts.</p><p></p><p>Jung told me in a phone interview that she was used to a scarcity model. If a major theater programmed a play by an Asian-American, she used to joke that her chances were shot for a production there the next season. What a dream then that for a few weeks in 2020 so many Asian-American plays were up.</p><p></p><p>Subjects ranged from a Cambodian band to Korean divers; from international adoption to a Hitchcockian murder mystery. The plays are bold and often outrageous (I detected <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/18/magazine/young-jean-lees-unsafe-spaces.html">Young Jean Lee’s acerbic influence</a> in a few scripts). From noir to porn to rock musical, these playwrights deploy genre to pickax their way into the nebulous inner lives of characters traumatized by migration, racism or genocide.</p><p></p><p>Favoring Brechtian devices over conventional realism, many of these playwrights write Asian-American characters with a self-conscious knowingness that they’re centering Asian bodies before a white audience. Often, they break the fourth wall or use multimedia — like Christopher Chen’s LCT3 production “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/24/theater/the-headlands-review.html">The Headlands</a>” — to unseat any preconceived notions the audience may have of the Asian race.</p><p></p><p>“I think a lot of playwrights who want to get into the meat of racial issues use experimental theater to get underneath reality,” said Chen, whose noir-inspired play delves into themysterious death of a Chinese immigrant in San Francisco.</p><p></p><p>Sometimes, just as the audience identifies with characters, the playwright unmasks them, exposing the scaffolding of the plot. The goal is not to please, or to entertain, but to provoke.</p><p></p><p>An influential playwright who uses avant-garde techniques to explode racial myths is Young Jean Lee. Following on the heels of Reza Abdoh and Suzan-Lori Parks, Lee projects her own prickly unease about her race onto her audience through scathing satire and bait-and-switch plotlines.</p><p></p><p>“In purely naturalistic theater you’re not supposed to break the fourth wall, and the main tool at your disposal is audience identification with the characters,” Lee said to me recently. “In experimental theater, you can use a wide range of techniques and tricks to have an emotional impact on the audience.”</p><p></p><p>“<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/25/theater/were-gonna-die-review.html">We’re Gonna Die</a>,” one of her more linear but no less confrontational plays, opened on Feb. 25 at Second Stage Theater. A one-woman show that weaves together blunt songs and stories about mortality, it was performed this time by Janelle McDermoth; in the 2011 original, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/11/theater/reviews/were-gonna-die-by-young-jean-lee-at-joes-pub-review.html">Lee took the role as a challenge</a> to herself because she was afraid to sing for an audience.</p><p></p><p>In Haruna Lee’s “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/04/theater/suicide-forest-review-bushwick-starr.html">Suicide Forest</a>,” which opened in February at A.R.T./New York Theaters, characters are drawn as Japanese stereotypes — repressed salaryman, submissive schoolgirl, scary ghost woman — only to be twisted apart like taffy.</p><p></p><p>The businessman’s teen daughters, who are in Lolita get-ups of silvery-pink pigtails and puffy frocks, are played by actresses in their 60s. Lee, 34, who is nonbinary, portrayed Azusa, the schoolgirl. Lee breaks character late in the action to confess that as a teenager, they masturbated to Hilary Swank’s love scene with Chloë Sevigny in the 1999 film <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bm3ZWDx6L0k">“Boys Don’t Cry.”</a></p><p></p><p>“Growing up in the U.S., stereotypes were handed to me,” Lee said in an interview, “and my conflict has been fulfilling those stereotypes to survive and actively pushing them away — but not knowing what I’m pushing them away into.”</p><p></p><p>Calling it a “nightmare bilingual play,” Lee made sure that large parts of the dialogue were in Japanese and that the cast was made up entirely of native speakers, including Lee’s mother. It was produced by <a href="http://ma-yitheatre.org/">Ma-Yi Theater Company</a>, which focuses on developing plays by Asian-American writers. Working with the director Aya Ogawa, also of Japanese descent, made a difference, too.</p><p></p><p>“When we had our first conversation, I could tell she understood the bones of the play and the simultaneity of Americanness and Japanese aesthetic,” Lee said. “That felt like a revelation.”</p><p></p><p>When Celine Song met with casting directors for her play “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/09/theater/endlings-review-celine-song.html">Endlings</a>,” which opened March 9 at New York Theater Workshop,they warned her it might be hard to find older Asian-American actresses for the roles of Korean hanyeos, or fisherwomen, in their 70s to 90s. Grandmas who make dumplings they are not. Instead they curse like truckers and talk about how they beat their children so they wouldn’t end up following their example.</p><p></p><p>But casting was easy because there were many actresses of Asian descent in New York who had struggled in their youth to find jobs. “During their time, white women were taking their roles and doing yellow face,” said Song, 31, who grew up in South Korea and Canada.</p><p></p><p>The play also features a character named Ha Young who is the stand-in for the playwright. Ha Young is ambivalently ambitious, confessing her desires to take over “great white theater” while simultaneously chastising herself for wanting to “sell out.” As she berates her audience, she might as well be berating herself for internalizing the white gaze: “Aren’t you excited to tell your friends? How you saw a weird play about weird old diving women from Korea?”</p><p></p><p>In Jung’s “Wolf Play,” co-produced by Ma-Yi Theater Company, a Korean boy is adopted by a white couple in Arizona. When the wife becomes pregnant, they decide they no longer want the child. Through a chat room, the couple illegally “rehomes” the boy with a family in San Francisco. Traumatized and dissociated, the child believes he’s a wolf, and he is represented by a puppet, a stark reminder that he has no control over his fate.</p><p></p><p>Jung said she was inspired to write the play after reading <a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/adoption/#_blank">a news story</a> about Facebook and Yahoo groups some Americans used to enlist new parents for their adopted children (most from other countries), as casually as if they were discarding unwanted furniture. “It sort of really, really enraged me,” Jung said.</p><p></p><p>Other plays that didn’t even have a chance to open include Jeremy Tiang’s “<a href="https://www.targetmargin.org/salesman/">Salesman之死</a>,” Melisa Tien’s “<a href="http://www.jackny.org/best-life.html">Best Life</a>” and Qui Nguyen’s“<a href="https://manhattantheatreclub.com/2019-20-season/poor-yella-rednecks/">Poor Yella Rednecks</a>.” On the other hand, Lauren Yee’s bawdy and gutting “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/24/theater/cambodian-rock-band-review.html">Cambodian Rock Band</a>” had a nearly six-week run at the Signature Theater before <strong>Covid-19</strong> shut it down. In the play, a former musician who survived the Khmer Rouge purge returns to his homeland, as his daughter there prepares to prosecute a notorious former leader on war crimes charges.</p><p></p><p>Since the pandemic has kept the writers holed up at home, Jung, Song and Chen said they were writing for TV, and Young Jean Lee is involved in several theatrical projects.</p><p></p><p>Most are hopeful about the wellspring of Asian-American voices, except for Song who was cautious about this moment in theater: “I don’t want to tell people there is a lot of Asian theater because then there will be a backlash. Theater will get complacent and stop programming Asian voices.”</p><p></p><p>Jung said she wasn’t sure what kind of stories people would want after the pandemic. Still, she was galvanized by her Asian-American peers. “We’re not just in the people of color slot anymore,” she said. “We have something to say to the world and not just to other Asians. When we come back, we’ll just have to double down.”</p><p></p><p>Cathy Park Hong is a poet and the author of the essay collection “Minor Feelings: An Asian-American Reckoning.”</p><p></p><p>Cathy Park Hong is a poet and the author of the essay collection “Minor Feelings: An Asian-American Reckoning.”</p><p></p><p>PHOTOS: Clockwise from top left: Johnny Wu, left, and Laura Kai Chen in Christopher Chen’s noir-inspired “The Headlands”; Hansol Jung, who wrote “Wolf Play”; the cast of Celine Song’s “Endlings,” about Korean fisherwomen, at New York Theater Workshop; Haruna Lee, who wrote “Suicide Forest,” at home in South Slope, Brooklyn.
