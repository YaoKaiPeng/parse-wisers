This represent 41 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent which on the planetary scale has allowed to cumulatively hold global warming for an entire year.”</p><p></p><p>This baseline maps to the collapse of the Soviet Union and its vast industries, making it a relatively easy baseline for the country to promote past success.</p><p></p><p><a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/energy/news/russia-readies-to-ratify-paris-agreement-warns-about-renewables-absolutism/">Russia readies to ratify Paris Agreement, warns about renewables 'absolutism'</a></p><p></p><p>The Russian government will submit legislation to ratify the Paris climate agreement by September, but president Vladimir Putin warned against the perils of “absolutist” renewable energy. EURACTIV’s media partner Climate Home News reports.</p><p></p><p>“Russia is making another colossal contribution to combatting CO2 emissions and CO2 sequestration which is not reflected in the contributions but is a crucial factor in this effort. These are Russia’s boreal forests which are the lungs of the planet,” Putin’s spokesman said.</p><p></p><p>Whereas he had previously intended to submit the decision to parliament, months of opposition from industry lobbyists and deputies have swayed president Putin to bypass the chamber and endorse the pact via a government accord. Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev signed the government decree in the day.</p><p></p><p>The country’s climate pledge is however notoriously weak, with Climate Action Tracker labelling it as “critically insufficient”.</p><p></p><p><a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/climate-environment/news/un-climate-summit-day-2-few-announcements-in-the-end-how-dare-you/">UN climate summit, day #2: Few announcements in the end – 'How dare you'</a></p><p></p><p>Over this special series on the UN climate action summit (23-25 September), EURACTIV gives you a glimpse into the goings on in New York and what is driving the conversation there. In this edition: An angry Greta Thunberg, a technical Angela Merkel, a passive Donald Trump and four ambitious EU member states.</p><p></p><p>Years of lobbying from Europe</p><p></p><p>Observers of the country’s climate policy welcomed the decision.</p><p></p><p>“It’s a really important signal for Russian society, for regional governors, for business, for NGOs, that Russia is onboard with global efforts,” Alexey Kokorin, WWF Russia climate programme director, told Climate Home News. “That Russia recognises the importance of the climate problem, and that Russia does not oppose the anthropogenic impact of climate change, which is already really important.”</p><p></p><p>“The adoption of the Paris Agreement increases the chances of preventing a global climate catastrophe, but this chance must be utilised correctly and, most importantly, taken quickly – there is no time left for compromises and attempts to maintain the status quo of a fossil power,” Greenpeace climate officer Vasily Yablokov said. “Russia’s actions in this matter are of great importance: our country has enormous potential to reduce greenhouse emissions.”</p><p></p><p>The move follows years of lobbying from European governments, including Germany, France and Scandinavian countries.</p><p></p><p>Long dead, climate policy has been twitching to life in Russia in recent months. The government is currently reviewing a law to regulate greenhouse gas emissions, along with two national plans for low-carbon development and adaptation.</p><p></p><p>The country’s announcement means that there are now eleven countries yet to formally ratify the Agreement. These are Angola, Eritrea, Iran, Iraq, Kyrgyzstan, Lebanon, Libya, Oman, South Sudan, Suriname, and Yemen.</p><p></p><p><a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/energy/news/as-america-retreats-on-climate-china-and-russia-confirm-commitments/">As America retreats on climate, China and Russia confirm commitments</a></p><p></p><p>The US president’s gambit to make the Paris Agreement collapse failed. Now China and Russia are taking advantage of the power vacuum left by the US to shape the accord’s rules – and show no signs of wavering on commitments.</p><p></p><p>文件 EURACOM020190924ef9o0002y</p><p></p><p><img src="data:image/gif;base64,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" /></p><p></p><p><a id="toc1"></a><strong>Russia readies to ratify Paris Agreement, warns about renewables ‘absolutism’</strong></p><p></p><p>Natalie Sauer </p><p>899 字</p><p>2019 年 7 月 10 日 15:24</p><p>EurActiv.com</p><p>EURACOM</p><p>英文</p><p>Copyright 2019.

Now China and Russia are taking advantage of the power vacuum left by the US to shape the accord’s rules – and show no signs of wavering on commitments.</p><p></p><p>Kremlin cites global shift to low-carbon energy</p><p></p><p>The move follows months of back-and-forth consultations between the economic development ministry, which penned the law, and the ministries of resources and environment and foreign affairs.</p><p></p><p>The government statement said ratification of the Paris Agreement “could give Russia additional opportunities to participate in all negotiation processes and protect its interests in international fora that define the rules for reducing CO2 emissions and develop relevant documents”.</p><p></p><p>Aside from the looming climate action summit, the government also cited a global shift in demand towards low carbon energy as a reason for the bill. “The world’s electric power industry is becoming less carbon-intensive, and this predetermines the competitive advantage of goods produced in countries with greener energy,” it read.</p><p></p><p>On Tuesday at a global manufacturing and industrialisation conference he was hosting in Yekaterinburg, president Vladimir Putin said Russia was experiencing the effects of the climate crisis, with Arctic temperatures rising faster than anywhere on the planet.</p><p></p><p>“The degradation of nature and climate continues,” Putin said. “And it’s getting more and more acute with droughts, bad harvests, natural disasters.”</p><p></p><p><a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/climate-strategy-2050/news/renewable-energy-will-be-worlds-main-power-source-by-2040-says-bp/">Renewable energy will be world's main power source by 2040, says BP</a></p><p></p><p>Renewable energies will be the world’s main source of power within two decades and are establishing a foothold in the global energy system faster than any fuel in history, according to BP.</p><p></p><p>The UK-based oil company said wind, solar and other renewables …</p><p></p><p>Putin rejects energy “absolutism”</p><p></p><p>However Putin said renewable energy should not lead to “the complete abandonment of nuclear or hydrocarbon energy”. He urged international cooperation on nuclear power development and warned against energy “absolutism” and said “blind faith in simple, showy, but ineffective solutions leads to problems”.</p><p></p><p>The Russian leader said: “Will it be comfortable for people to live on a planet with a palisade of wind turbines and several layers of solar panels?”</p><p></p><p>He continued: “Everybody knows wind energy is good, but are they remembering about the birds in this case? How many birds are dying? They shake so much that worms come out of the ground. Really, it’s not a joke, it’s a serious consequence of these modern ways of getting energy. I’m not saying that it doesn’t need to be developed, of course, but we shouldn’t forget about the problems associated with it.”</p><p></p><p>There are no references to worms emerging from the ground because of the vibration of windmills in scientific literature. The only online mention in English is a 2011 post on a US anti-wind power blog site.</p><p></p><p><a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/energy/news/hungary-wins-final-eu-approval-for-russian-built-nuclear-plant/">Hungary wins final EU approval for Russian-built nuclear plant</a></p><p></p><p>The European Commission cleared on Monday (6 March) the last hurdle for Hungary’s nuclear project Paks II despite outstanding concerns about the role of the national regulator and spent fuel management.</p><p></p><p>Russia is in the process of reviewing a framework climate legislation to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. Currently under debate in Russia’s upper chamber, the legislation would give the government powers to introduce greenhouse gas emission targets for companies and charges for those that exceed them, with proceeds potentially going into a fund to support carbon-cutting projects. It also lays the groundwork for a cap and trade system, emissions permits and tax breaks for companies reducing or capturing their emissions.</p><p></p><p>NGOs have cautiously welcomed the bills in a country traditionally hostile to climate action, with the autocratic regime repeatedly <a href="https://www.climatechangenews.com/2019/05/23/russia-allows-us-rise-together-i-will-strike-climate-alone/">thwarting any attempt by students to organise climate marches</a>.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, the government continues to seek out partnerships with China for oil exploration in the Arctic.

He was upset about Donald Trump’s announcement to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, saying his city would not withdraw.</p><p></p><p>Peduto is one of the leaders of the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy, which met in Paris last week (26-27 June).</p><p></p><p>///</p><p></p><p>In 2017, President Donald Trump decided that the United States should withdraw from the Paris climate agreement. What has changed since then?</p><p></p><p>Before the president’s announcement, sixty US cities decided to commit to the Paris climate agreement. There are now 400 of us.</p><p></p><p>The majority of Americans are now concerned by climate change. We are mainly talking about those who live in cities that are most affected by climate change.</p><p></p><p>Most of our carbon footprint is related to urban planning, including that of transportation systems and buildings.</p><p></p><p>We still have a lot to do, especially when it comes to coal and energy-intensive industries.</p><p></p><p>What can mayors do?</p><p></p><p>As mayors, we can go a long way. We can reduce the use of private cars through efficient public transport and invest in more efficient real estate.</p><p></p><p>In Pittsburgh, our plan is for the city’s energy to be 100% renewable by 2045 and by 2030, this would already be the case for the municipality’s operations.</p><p></p><p>Right now, we use mostly nuclear and coal, so it will take time.</p><p></p><p>How do people react to such announcements?</p><p></p><p>We are told that we are crazy and that it is impossible. We are also told that it is not enough.</p><p></p><p>However, we don’t focus on extreme reactions! What matters is that every day we do something to make our commitments happen. It’s substantive work!</p><p></p><p>Could a price on carbon help?</p><p></p><p>Yes, of course. And this question will be crucial during the presidential primaries of the Democratic Party.

So for the moment,  I believe that putting a price on carbon would be complicated.</p><p></p><p>Do you think climate protection will be an issue in the American presidential elections?</p><p></p><p>There are two topics on which young people will get an idea of the candidates: firearms and the environment.</p><p></p><p>Usually, these issues are not discussed, but this time it will be different.</p><p></p><p>After the 2016 campaign, many citizens wondered why the mainstream media was not talking to candidates about the environment.</p><p></p><p>If they do this again, the debate on climate will be taking place on social, informal and local networks.</p><p></p><p>How can the environment become an issue for voters?</p><p></p><p>The issue is particularly important in our states of Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan and Wisconsin. In 2016, Trump convinced them that voting for the environment was voting against their jobs.</p><p></p><p>In 2020, the Democratic candidate must have an explicit programme on the issue and make it clear that voting for the environment will give jobs to the voters and their children.</p><p></p><p>We seriously need to invest in the states that built the US.</p><p></p><p>The Democratic candidate needs to suggest a ‘Marshall Plan’ for the cities most affected by economic change.</p><p></p><p>In 2016, Democrats promised to teach manual workers how to code. Yet, for them, this seemed like an insult. They and their parents built America with their hands from the ground up and now they were being asked to sit behind a computer…</p><p></p><p>How do cities cooperate on climate protection?</p><p></p><p>Pittsburgh is a good example because the city has come a long way!</p><p></p><p>In the 1940s, public lighting was being constantly used because the pollution was so thick. This is because of the furnaces and the coal-fired power plants. We used to be the most polluted city in the US and were nicknamed the city of “hell with the lid taken off”!</p><p></p><p>Today, we are not the best, but the air quality has been significantly improved. Representatives from Vietnam and China even come to visit us to understand how this is even possible. And it gives them hope.</p><p></p><p>What was Pittsburgh’s magic recipe?</p><p></p><p>Initially, there was a major effort by the city, which organised public-private partnerships to clean up the air, water and riverbanks. It attracted cultural investments, contributing to the building of several museums, the university, etc…</p><p></p><p>Now Pittsburgh has become a major centre for research and development, particularly in the field of artificial intelligence applied to medicine.</p><p></p><p>If we all work together, progress will be much faster.</p><p></p><p>Europe has always been proud of its leadership on climate protection. However, the member states are currently unable to agree on a carbon neutrality target for 2050. Does this situation compromise Europe’s exemplary role?</p><p></p><p>Europe should be proud of its climate action. Europe is a source of inspiration and its innovations and environmental initiatives are being followed globally.</p><p></p><p>Europe is where the rest of the world will be in 10 years’ time when the effects of climate change will be even more obvious. At that point, Europe will be far ahead.</p><p></p><p>In Pittsburgh, we worked with the Danish government and the Danish city of Aarhus. We learned how they were able to reduce their energy consumption by 50% through a local energy plan.</p><p></p><p>There is no need to invent the wheel. We have signed a cooperation agreement that will allow us to progress faster.</p><p></p><p>Of course, when policies stagnate temporarily, it is disappointing. Yet, Europe is still so far ahead, compared to the rest of the world.</p><p></p><p>The US is expected to officially announce its withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement in November and the withdrawal will then be effective in November 2020.

EurActiv.com All Rights Reserved. </p><p></p><p>A few days before the EU Summit, climate diplomats are gathering in Bonn to agree on rules for trading CO2 certificates and financial mechanisms designed to support developing countries, two agenda items from the Paris Agreement that remain unresolved. <a href="https://www.euractiv.de/section/energie-und-umwelt/news/klimakonferenz-in-bonn-soll-pariser-regelbuch-vollenden/">EURACTIV Germany reports</a>.</p><p></p><p>Around 3,000 climate experts from all over the world have been meeting since Monday at the UN Climate Summit in Bonn, preparing the COP25 conference, where important decisions left over from COP24 in Poland will have to be made.</p><p></p><p>The Bonn conference had a rocky start. A proposal to set the agenda for negotiations on the topic of emissions trading was rejected by some states, said Rixa Schwarz, who is on location representing the environmental and development organisation Germanwatch.</p><p></p><p>During preliminary negotiations in Bonn, diplomats will decide on a concept that will establish clear rules for the emission certificates, established in 1997 under the so-called Kyoto Protocol.</p><p></p><p>Since the Protocol became effective in 2005, signatory nations that are subject to caps on their emissions of Greenhouse gases (GHGs) have been committed to reducing targets during both commitment periods that started in 2008.</p><p></p><p>They have committed to buying CO2 certificates in developing countries through environmentally friendly measures, which they can credit to their national climate accounts. These countries that produce a high amount of CO2, so-called Annex 1 countries, include all EU member states but exclude high polluters such as the US and China.</p><p></p><p>However, the Kyoto Protocol expires in 2020, by which time new standards need to be found and a decision taken on what will happen to old certificates.</p><p></p><p><a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/aviation/news/un-environment-official-attacks-agencys-own-carbon-offsetting-policy/">UN Environment official attacks agency’s own carbon offsetting policy</a></p><p></p><p>UN Environment published an unusually stark critique of carbon offsetting on Monday (10 June). On Tuesday, the article was taken down, following queries by EURACTIV’s partner Climate Home News.</p><p></p><p>So far, emissions trading schemes at a global level have encountered the issue of double debiting. The attribution of pollution rights to both selling and importing states should be avoided.</p><p></p><p>Also, countries like Brazil, which previously benefitted greatly from the certificates through climate-friendly projects, have been campaigning to include emissions certificates in their climate plans and sell them as pollution rights.</p><p></p><p>There are no clear regulations on this yet, and the question of what will happen to the certificates acquired after 2020 also remains to be clarified.</p><p></p><p>One goal of the negotiations in Bonn will, therefore, be to close these loopholes, which will be one of the conference’s main challenges, according to Jennifer Tollmann, a policy adviser at the climate think tank E3G.</p><p></p><p>To do so, one should be paying attention to the political interests of states and “find solutions to preserve the credibility of the system, without neglecting countries like Brazil,” she told EURACTIV.</p><p></p><p>Who will foot the climate damage bill?</p><p></p><p>The “Warsaw mechanism”, intended to compensate for loss and damages, seems to be just as politically sensitive. It has been in place since 2013 and serves to provide technical and financial support to developing countries suffering from the consequences of climate change.</p><p></p><p>So far, such states have only been supported in the form of a fund for adaptation to climate change, and their own financing model has not yet been worked out. The fund, which has so far approved projects worth $532 million, is, however, insufficiently equipped from the point of view of the developing countries.</p><p></p><p>With the US having withdrawn from the Paris climate agreement, there will be an even greater financing gap. Germany, therefore, announced that it would double its contributions to reach a total of €1.5 billion at the last COP24 in November 2018.</p><p></p><p>“Other countries, like France, should follow suit and do the same,” said Schwarz of Germanwatch.</p><p></p><p>The “Warsaw mechanism” raises some politically sensitive questions. What is considered climate-related damage? Which countries are held responsible?</p><p></p><p>“It will take time before responsibilities are acknowledged. Only small steps are being taken,” Schwarz explained.</p><p></p><p>Right now, there is a particular focus on China. When the Kyoto Protocol was first adopted, China was considered to be a developing country, meaning it had fewer obligations. Now, China seems intent on benefitting from such a status.</p><p></p><p>“China is a strong political advocate of the developing world. Yet, this does not coincide with the financing China is willing to provide for developing countries,” said Tollmann of the climate think-tank E3G.</p><p></p><p>A look at the EU summit</p><p></p><p>Although no official decisions have yet been taken in Bonn, states are under political pressure. The Paris Agreement stipulates that its signatories must increase their climate promises in the coming year.</p><p></p><p>However, some states are showing resistance. Saudi Arabia, for example, lodged an objection to putting an item on the agenda related to the recognition of scientific findings, Tollmann said.</p><p></p><p><a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/climate-strategy-2050/news/18-eu-countries-sign-up-to-2050-carbon-neutrality-goal/">18 EU countries now support 2050 carbon neutrality goal</a></p><p></p><p>Germany, Greece, Italy and Slovenia have added their names to a growing list of EU countries supporting a carbon neutrality objective for 2050, increasing the chances that a deal will be struck at an EU summit later this week, according to documents seen by EURACTIV.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, at an EU summit on 20-21 June in Brussels, a majority of states may support an EU goal of going climate neutral by 2050. This has become even more likely because Germany is now showing greater commitment.</p><p></p><p>According to David Waskow of the American World Resources Institute, such a step would have a knock-on effect on the UN.</p><p></p><p>Last week UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called on EU Council President Donald Tusk to raise the EU’s carbon reduction target for 2030 – from the current 40% to 55% – before this September’s UN Climate Action Summit organised by the UN Secretary-General.</p><p></p><p>“Such a decision by the EU would be decisive for negotiations in September,” Waskow added.</p><p></p><p>[Edited by Zoran Radosavljevic]</p><p></p><p>文件 EURACOM020190619ef6j0005r</p><p></p><p><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhMAAoAPcAAAAAAP////j0AP//APn1AB4loSEoniIpnSMqnCUsmyYtmicumictmSwyljA2lDo/jC41lS82kzI5kjM5kTQ6kDU7jzc9jjk/jDpAjDpAizxBijxCij9EiEBGh0BFh0JHhkNIhUVKhEVKg0ZLg01RfUhNgUlOgEpPgEtQgExRf09UfVBUfFNXelNXeVRYeVlcdVFWe1VZeFVZd1dbd1xfc1hcdlpedFledVtfc11hcltgc19jcWFkb2Jlb15jcmBkcGNmbmVobWZpbGZqa2ptaW1xZmxvZ3BzZHN2YnR3YXR3Ynh7XnZ5YHp9XX1/W4yOUIqMUYqMUomLUoeJU4OFVYSGVoGDV36AWX6AWq6vNqusOaqrOqmqOqOkPqKjQKGiQJ+gQZ+gQp6fQp2eQ52eRJmaRpiZR5eYR5iZSJaYSZSVSZOUTJGSTJCRTY2PT4qLUYiJUnx9W//8AP/+AP36APv4APn2Aff0Afn2Avj1Avf0AvbzAvXyA/TxBPPwBfHuBfHuBvDtBu/sBvTxB/LvB+7rB/T0CPTxCPHuCO7rCO3qCO/tCezpCe3qCuvoCurnC+zpDOrnDOfkDOnmDebjDefkD+TiD+ThEOPgEOLfEeHeEePhEuHeEt/dE97cE97bFN7cFdzZFdzaFdvYFdzaFtzZFtvYFtnXF9nYGNnXGNzbGdfVGdfVGtXTGdnXG9XTGtPSG9TSHNLQHNHPHdHQHtDOHs/OHs/NH8/NIMzLIM3MIcvKIcvJIczLIsvKIsrIIsnIIsnHI8jGJMfFJcXEJsTDJsPBJ8LBKMHAKMC/KcC/Kr++KsHAK7+/LLy7Lbu6Lb29Lrq5Lrq6L7m4L7i3L7m5MLi3MLe2Mba1MbW0MrOyM7GxNLCwNa6tN62tN6yrOKysOKurOaioO6enPKamPaWlPaSkPqOjP6GhQaCgQp2dRJqaRpKSS//6AP75AP35APz3APr1APr2APjzAPj0APfzAfbxAvXxA/TwA/LuBfHtBejkDOXhD9bTGtLPHP///yH5BAEAAP8ALAAAAAAwACgAAAj/AAUIHEiwoMGDCBMqXMiwoUOF8uC1kzNngMU5ct7VIfCwI4F3GO3ts/UMnDkv5LYdOyWozgA68TpCzJgJXBMWHDRk2ODBw4YHDy6ACHJmVp45dWQWlDenDzYiHU4cMUNtViZGhQoporQqWRcnLjjgEEdIDkelcvBkcUFCCq8/dAbIaVenbl147uTIrRcKHQ8c2TR6HNCvBwtwgOTKO7tQ3rsB8oAtgdLonUN5crKMUONnQFKlAgjIoXNszKPPCkWTKSHMM+iCoie9ajhHiwhWcuXISyiv3W7YlgnMkTevDp56C+X049BsgCVkwQr9hh0IFiDGAvnySTSOH+rU74gg/xngRUSOGMsGcJRTh44cvVsWZJkjgOmAOapSGKpEg5b6eXTQkVA7sljQCy4XICNHPo44o48AyHQSTC7Y5GHEBkfU8c4i3oCxyhkZiJGKM7E8w8c7ugTzHUEDrGMBH3DAcIss72TyQSb1yJBFDyW08YoK1YRQyh5A7FDFMldccEUyKlwDgi90tBAGfQaJ1gQHe8RhQQpJyJPJCJjcYcM2NbQxwBpKDLBDOs6YsIhcroxwCCIioHJEFLGEcMmKAhFQRxIUJDJFC37IM8AmI1SCBwvb/DCNHDPIAEcKQaDhg3tyyDICIYmI8Ik0MTTBhFkHiVbFASRK8MQqwxTjQTHeOP+gjQ7O2ALCN9uU88EbHDhzCiOrZMALJh20wgcKERwjR0IDgHMAEHRY88IKNxzjxgmiJnPFLuRMYZEcTYSRBgk24CJAESlkc8QoA5ghRKEJ1VHJCAqoM4AeiuQjjx2K5KHHHvbU44ceHBGgRx/vCCJIPfLsocg9AXO0B3YHzUGOAhCQo1hoGxHg8ccDLebnZ/JstFho0/EmzxIIQMCOHqS+Fo9d77yTMkLvEIJEAgz0kMt7NzckTz6iiGKJKatIErRB7+jBxgQGTLAEL3koRnGVHrszThpUWIEFE14sy1AdcvwyBAQFRLDDGLLk85hc7bhT80Tv6cFIPpmM8w0YWTD/A80wfCYkhx3GLNGBAgVAwKUa3SBTyyqirJKLM1mUs00uighgRx551CHP5zJhRgcl10ARhAgSNBBBBRhwEAILREgRjiyFbBSax32+5idGAgSCCSy/CBPMLJoossd771z90MmhHRTPO6O9Nxcdnvc5HcgN1VNIH3fUw0ceAtBVV/L6JEJcIXa4kw8+GtWxRyAavnMPAffYUXPNCNWRSRbDfHLKNNkIxi48AQpSyEIO2vACHxhRBmTAYhq/eIUpIjELdfCiH6eoBTeSsYpXzKKDEzNIHUIhjmcQQxbKYMMUyMEFJ4yDHPXABhSWwYgudIML4ihHNLaBjVtwwRtc+EI2dbihhXB4QR3Z+IIighaPQuiiE8PQxyQ+MYtXcCIWn7AFHzxxDFPgAxKbGKAoZqGNVChiEKx4hT9CcYpXwMIWmcDELgKhPAJQjw4EKFnNNKQhAZCtY+25iyXq85E9xk8j8sDja8a2yEY68pGQjKQkJ0nJShIkIAA7" /></p><p></p><p><a id="toc5"></a><strong>Leaked report reveals ‘misfunctioning’ of Energy Charter Treaty amid EU reform calls</strong></p><p></p><p>Frédéric Simon </p><p>1,430 字</p><p>2019 年 6 月 7 日 14:29</p><p>EurActiv.com</p><p>EURACOM</p><p>英文</p><p>Copyright 2019. EurActiv.com All Rights Reserved. </p><p></p><p>A confidential internal report, obtained by EURACTIV, lists the multiple failings of the Energy Charter secretariat, at a time when the treaty is undergoing a major revision process and is being used by Russia’s Nord Stream 2 pipeline in a first-time legal proceeding against the EU.</p><p></p><p>Signed in 1991 after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Energy Charter’s initial objective was to provide legal protection for Western companies investing in the former communist bloc.</p><p></p><p>The treaty focuses chiefly on oil and gas activities and covers all aspects of energy trade and transit, including a dispute settlement mechanism aimed at protecting investors from “political risks” such as expropriation, nationalisation, or damages due to war.</p><p></p><p>Today, the Energy Charter boasts 55 full members, including countries as varied as Switzerland, Japan, Central Asia’s three energy-rich states – Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan – the European Union, and all its member states with the exception of Italy.</p><p></p><p>While most people have never heard about the Energy Charter, it is well-known to lawyers <a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/energy/opinion/exploring-the-limits-of-eus-unbelievable-behaviour-on-nord-stream-2/">who recently initiated legal proceedings against the EU</a> under the treaty on behalf of the Gazprom-owned Nord Stream 2 company, in what would constitute a first.</p><p></p><p>But calls for reform are now growing louder, <a href="http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/press/index.cfm?id=2017">with the European Commission recently describing the treaty as “outdated,”</a> notably when it comes to investor protection clauses, climate change and the clean energy transition.</p><p></p><p>Damning internal report</p><p></p><p>And now, reform calls are also coming from the inside.</p><p></p><p>A confidential internal report, prepared by the Energy Charter’s assistant secretary general Masami Nakata, and obtained by EURACTIV, makes a detailed analysis of the “misfunctioning of the energy charter’s secretariat,” based in Brussels.</p><p></p><p>“This misfunctioning,” Nakata writes, “is principally attributable to a failed organisational restructuring” led by Urban Rusnák, a Slovak diplomat who was appointed secretary general  of the Energy Charter Treaty in 2012.</p><p></p><p>In the report’s firing line are the “management methods” of Rusnák, including the repeated “unprofessional and non-transparent selection of officials” and unlawful dismissal of senior staff members, which she says is “undermining the performance of the organisation as a whole”.</p><p></p><p>An attempt to restructure the organisation, conducted in 2016, is described in the report as “an abject failure” which resulted in the extensive use of low-grade staff, interns, and temporary contracts, leading to “serious concerns about both the quality and quantity of the secretariat’s output”.</p><p></p><p>“There are compelling reasons to believe that, as a consequence, the results of the organisation are insufficient and well below par,” Nakata writes, pointing to a “lack of concrete, tangible results and real progress” in the secretariat’s main areas of work.</p><p></p><p>The Japanese official even suggests that the financial and human resources made available by treaty signatories “are thus being wasted and possibly misused”.</p><p></p><p>Nakata’s position is now advertised as vacant on the Energy Charter website.</p><p></p><p>&gt; <a href="https://www.euractiv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/06/ECT_report_v2.pdf">Download the report here</a> (pdf).</p><p></p><p>“Modernisation” process</p><p></p><p>The damning internal report comes at a crucial moment for the Energy Charter Treaty, which initiated a “modernisation” process last year, aimed at aligning the pact with other international accords, such as the Paris Agreement on climate change.</p><p></p><p>But that process isn’t going smoothly. Any changes to the treaty would require a unanimous decision by the Energy Charter Conference, which brings together the 55 signatories, Nakata writes in her report.</p><p></p><p>And “it is unlikely that Contracting Parties would reach an agreement to align the Treaty with the Paris Climate Agreement,” she adds, pointing out that member states are too far apart on clean energy development and have conflicting interests when it comes to fossil fuels.</p><p></p><p>While the EU, Japan and Switzerland have developed decarbonisation strategies, “other contracting parties are either fossil fuel exporting countries” or “transit countries for fossil fuels,” Nakata remarks.</p><p></p><p>Contacted by EURACTIV, Rusnák acknowledged the report’s existence but said its contents were “not balanced” and contained “unfounded allegations” on his management style.</p><p></p><p>Regarding the treaty’s modernisation process, he said: “I cannot comment on this because we are not there yet.” Treaty signatories still need to agree the substance of the modernisation process, he explained, saying reform mandates are still being discussed around the world, including the EU.</p><p></p><p>“All my work since day one was to modernise the Energy Charter Treaty, which deserves to be modernised,” Rusnák told EURACTIV.</p><p></p><p>However, a clear impression that transpires from the report is that Rusnák enjoys little trust from senior staffers at the Energy Charter Secretariat. One insider who spoke to EURACTIV on condition of anonymity, pointed to Rusnák’s close connections with Russia where he studied in his youth, graduating from the Moscow institute of oil and gas in 1990.</p><p></p><p>Although Russia pulled out of the treaty in 2012, Russian if frequently spoken at meetings, the source said, because most of the member countries are from the former soviet bloc. And because all meetings take place in English, Russian-language “interpreters” are present at all times to allow smoother exchanges between Central Asian representatives, the source said.</p><p></p><p>Treaty “outdated” EU says</p><p></p><p>The “modernisation” of the Energy Charter Treaty is scheduled to be officially started by the end of 2019, covering topics such as investment protection, pre-investment commitments, transit, the economic integration agreements clause and some provisions related to dispute resolution.</p><p></p><p>One of the key actors in the treaty’s modernisation process is the EU and its member states, which together contribute around 65% to the €4m annual budget of the Energy Charter Secretariat in Brussels.</p><p></p><p>In May this year, <a href="http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/press/index.cfm?id=2017">the European Commission proposed a draft mandate</a> to negotiate the treaty’s revision on behalf of the 28 EU member states. The mandate is currently being discussed among the 28, with EU countries expected to reach a decision by the end of June.</p><p></p><p>And according to the EU executive, the need to revise the treaty has become urgent.</p><p></p><p>“Since its establishment in the 1990s, the ECT provisions have hardly been revised,” the Commission notes in its proposal. This is particularly visible in the area of investment protection, where the treaty’s rules “do not correspond to modern standards as reflected in the EU’s reformed approach on investment protection,” the Commission adds, saying “those outdated provisions are no longer sustainable or adequate for the current challenges.”</p><p></p><p>“Yet it is today the most litigated investment agreement in the world, with a total of at least 121 investment notified disputes,” it adds.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the number of disputes has soared since 2012, when Rusnák was appointed secretary general. From an average of 3 to 4 cases per year, the number of investment disputes rose sharply afterwards, reaching a peak of 29 new disputes in 2015.</p><p></p><p>Environmental campaigners have long denounced the treaty, saying it grants energy companies disproportionate powers to sue governments, for example over a decision to stop new oil or gas pipelines or to phase out coal.</p><p></p><p>The most famous example is when Russian oil company Yukos won a nearly 10-year-long case against Russia on the basis of the treaty, with a record-breaking $50 billion award.

EurActiv.com All Rights Reserved. </p><p></p><p>A confidential internal report, obtained by EURACTIV, lists the multiple failings of the Energy Charter secretariat, at a time when the treaty is undergoing a major revision process and is being used by Russia’s Nord Stream 2 pipeline in a first-time legal proceeding against the EU.</p><p></p><p>Signed in 1991 after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Energy Charter’s initial objective was to provide legal protection for Western companies investing in the former communist bloc.</p><p></p><p>The treaty focuses chiefly on oil and gas activities and covers all aspects of energy trade and transit, including a dispute settlement mechanism aimed at protecting investors from “political risks” such as expropriation, nationalisation, or damages due to war.</p><p></p><p>Today, the Energy Charter boasts 55 full members, including countries as varied as Switzerland, Japan, Central Asia’s three energy-rich states – Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan – the European Union, and all its member states with the exception of Italy.</p><p></p><p>While most people have never heard about the Energy Charter, it is well-known to lawyers <a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/energy/opinion/exploring-the-limits-of-eus-unbelievable-behaviour-on-nord-stream-2/">who recently initiated legal proceedings against the EU</a> under the treaty on behalf of the Gazprom-owned Nord Stream 2 company, in what would constitute a first.</p><p></p><p>But calls for reform are now growing louder, <a href="http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/press/index.cfm?id=2017">with the European Commission recently describing the treaty as “outdated,”</a> notably when it comes to investor protection clauses, climate change and the clean energy transition.</p><p></p><p>Damning internal report</p><p></p><p>And now, reform calls are also coming from the inside.</p><p></p><p>A confidential internal report, prepared by the Energy Charter’s assistant secretary general Masami Nakata, and obtained by EURACTIV, makes a detailed analysis of the “misfunctioning of the energy charter’s secretariat,” based in Brussels.</p><p></p><p>“This misfunctioning,” Nakata writes, “is principally attributable to a failed organisational restructuring” led by Urban Rusnák, a Slovak diplomat who was appointed secretary general  of the Energy Charter Treaty in 2012.</p><p></p><p>In the report’s firing line are the “management methods” of Rusnák, including the repeated “unprofessional and non-transparent selection of officials” and unlawful dismissal of senior staff members, which she says is “undermining the performance of the organisation as a whole”.</p><p></p><p>An attempt to restructure the organisation, conducted in 2016, is described in the report as “an abject failure” which resulted in the extensive use of low-grade staff, interns, and temporary contracts, leading to “serious concerns about both the quality and quantity of the secretariat’s output”.</p><p></p><p>“There are compelling reasons to believe that, as a consequence, the results of the organisation are insufficient and well below par,” Nakata writes, pointing to a “lack of concrete, tangible results and real progress” in the secretariat’s main areas of work.</p><p></p><p>The Japanese official even suggests that the financial and human resources made available by treaty signatories “are thus being wasted and possibly misused”.</p><p></p><p>Nakata’s position is now advertised as vacant on the Energy Charter website.</p><p></p><p>“Modernisation” process</p><p></p><p>The damning internal report comes at a crucial moment for the Energy Charter Treaty, which initiated a “modernisation” process last year, aimed at aligning the pact with other international accords, such as the Paris Agreement on climate change.</p><p></p><p>But that process isn’t going smoothly. Any changes to the treaty would require a unanimous decision by the Energy Charter Conference, which brings together the 55 signatories, Nakata writes in her report.</p><p></p><p>And “it is unlikely that Contracting Parties would reach an agreement to align the Treaty with the Paris Climate Agreement,” she adds, pointing out that member states are too far apart on clean energy development and have conflicting interests when it comes to fossil fuels.</p><p></p><p>While the EU, Japan and Switzerland have developed decarbonisation strategies, “other contracting parties are either fossil fuel exporting countries” or “transit countries for fossil fuels,” Nakata remarks.</p><p></p><p>Contacted by EURACTIV, Rusnák acknowledged the report’s existence but said its contents were “not balanced” and contained “unfounded allegations” on his management style.</p><p></p><p>Regarding the treaty’s modernisation process, he said: “I cannot comment on this because we are not there yet.” Treaty signatories still need to agree the substance of the modernisation process, he explained, saying reform mandates are still being discussed around the world, including the EU.</p><p></p><p>“All my work since day one was to modernise the Energy Charter Treaty, which deserves to be modernised,” Rusnák told EURACTIV.</p><p></p><p>However, a clear impression that transpires from the report is that Rusnák enjoys little trust from senior staffers at the Energy Charter Secretariat. One insider who spoke to EURACTIV on condition of anonymity, pointed to Rusnák’s close connections with Russia where he studied in his youth, graduating from the Moscow institute of oil and gas in 1990.</p><p></p><p>Although Russia pulled out of the treaty in 2012, Russian if frequently spoken at meetings, the source said, because most of the member countries are from the former soviet bloc. And because all meetings take place in English, Russian-language “interpreters” are present at all times to allow smoother exchanges between Central Asian representatives, the source said.</p><p></p><p>Treaty “outdated” EU says</p><p></p><p>The “modernisation” of the Energy Charter Treaty is scheduled to be officially started by the end of 2019, covering topics such as investment protection, pre-investment commitments, transit, the economic integration agreements clause and some provisions related to dispute resolution.</p><p></p><p>One of the key actors in the treaty’s modernisation process is the EU and its member states, which together contribute around 65% to the €4m annual budget of the Energy Charter Secretariat in Brussels.</p><p></p><p>In May this year, <a href="http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/press/index.cfm?id=2017">the European Commission proposed a draft mandate</a> to negotiate the treaty’s revision on behalf of the 28 EU member states. The mandate is currently being discussed among the 28, with EU countries expected to reach a decision by the end of June.</p><p></p><p>And according to the EU executive, the need to revise the treaty has become urgent.</p><p></p><p>“Since its establishment in the 1990s, the ECT provisions have hardly been revised,” the Commission notes in its proposal. This is particularly visible in the area of investment protection, where the treaty’s rules “do not correspond to modern standards as reflected in the EU’s reformed approach on investment protection,” the Commission adds, saying “those outdated provisions are no longer sustainable or adequate for the current challenges.”</p><p></p><p>“Yet it is today the most litigated investment agreement in the world, with a total of at least 121 investment notified disputes,” it adds.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the number of disputes has soared since 2012, when Rusnák was appointed secretary general. From an average of 3 to 4 cases per year, the number of investment disputes rose sharply afterwards, reaching a peak of 29 new disputes in 2015.</p><p></p><p>Environmental campaigners have long denounced the treaty, saying it grants energy companies disproportionate powers to sue governments, for example over a decision to stop new oil or gas pipelines or to phase out coal.</p><p></p><p>The most famous example is when Russian oil company Yukos won a nearly 10-year-long case against Russia on the basis of the treaty, with a record-breaking $50 billion award. Russia has since pulled out of the treaty.</p><p></p><p>“The ECT is a powerful tool in the hands of big oil, gas, and coal companies to discourage governments from transitioning to clean energy,” argue the Corporate Europe Observatory (CEO) and the Transnational Institute (TNI), two research and campaign groups.</p><p></p><p>“They have used the ECT and other investment deals to challenge oil drilling bans, the rejection of pipelines, taxes on fossil fuels, and moratoria on and phase-outs of controversial types of energy. Corporations have also used the ECT to bully decision-makers into submission,” they write in a report called “<a href="https://www.tni.org/en/energy-charter-dirty-secrets">One treaty to rule them all</a>”.</p><p></p><p>Discussions have now started to expand the treaty to countries in Africa, the Middle East, Asia and Latin America.

EurActiv.com All Rights Reserved. </p><p></p><p>The US president’s gambit to make the Paris Agreement collapse failed. Now China and Russia are taking advantage of the power vacuum left by the US to shape the accord’s rules – and show no signs of wavering on commitments.</p><p></p><p>In June 2017, when Donald Trump announced he would be taking the United States out of the Paris Climate Agreement, all eyes turned to Beijing.</p><p></p><p>Historically, UN climate negotiations were made or broken – usually broken – by the Washington-Beijing power dynamic. Both refused to move unless the other did. George W. Bush refused to ratify the 1997 Kyoto Protocol because China hadn’t signed up to obligations, and in 2009 negotiations for a new climate accord in Copenhagen collapsed amid mutual distrust between China and America.</p><p></p><p>When both Beijing and Washington signed up to the Paris Climate Accord in 2015, it was considered nothing short of a diplomatic miracle.</p><p></p><p>So when Trump pulled the US out two years later, it was expected China might follow suit citing the unfairness of having its economic development held back while the US, its biggest economic competitor, remained unconstrained.</p><p></p><p>But 2017 didn’t play out like those previous years had. Rather than pulling out of the agreement in response to Trump’s announcement, China doubled down on its commitments. Shortly afterwards, China’s Special Representative on Climate Change, Xie Zhenhua, travelled to Brussels to hold a <a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/climate-environment/news/trump-told-that-paris-agreement-is-irreversible-and-non-negotiable/">summit</a> with the European Union and Canada to announce his country’s determination to stay in the accord.</p><p></p><p>The Paris Agreement is “very effective and efficient”, Xie Zhenhua said in Brussels, and he called on all parties to the Paris deal to decide “how we should combine climate actions with economic growth, the protection of people and job creation.” China is currently rolling out a national emissions cap-and-trade scheme to lower its emissions.</p><p></p><p><a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/climate-environment/news/trump-told-that-paris-agreement-is-irreversible-and-non-negotiable/">Trump told that Paris Agreement is ‘irreversible and non-negotiable’</a></p><p></p><p>The terms of the Paris Agreement are set in stone, the EU, China and Canada agreed at a summit in Montreal this weekend, while Washington was forced to deny that the US is planning to stay in the accord.</p><p></p><p>Russia, another heavy emitter which was closely watched following Trump’s announcement, did not follow America’s lead either. The country has implemented legislation on reducing gas flaring as well as new energy efficiency measures. It has continued to implement its 2009 Climate Doctrine setting out a strategy to meet its Paris agreement commitments.</p><p></p><p>That Beijing and Moscow did not waver in the face of US inaction was partly due to the intensive diplomatic efforts of the European Union and its climate commissioner Miguel Arias Cañete, who worked the phones overtime to ensure that all the BRICS – including India, Brazil and South Africa – remained committed to the accord.</p><p></p><p>“With the collapse of ambition in the United States, Europe will ensure we make our planet great again,” he said at the tripartite Brussels summit. “Our ambitious climate policy agenda has the most important backing of all.”</p><p></p><p>And although he flirted with the idea of leaving the climate accord during his campaign, Brazil’s new president Jair Bolsonaro has backed away from that threat since being elected.</p><p></p><p>China and Russia in UN climate </p><p></p><p>So what has Beijing and Moscow’s role been in the UN climate negotiations now that the world’s biggest historical emitter has pulled out? To understand this, it’s important to note that the United States hasn’t actually left the climate accord yet.</p><p></p><p>Under the terms of the agreement, a country cannot leave until two years after it has taken effect, which means the US can’t leave until November 2020 – coincidentally just a few days after the next American presidential election.</p><p></p><p>In the meantime, US state department officials have sought to have a full role in negotiations on the accord’s rule book, which has prompted speculation that the US doesn’t actually intend to pull out at all.</p><p></p><p><a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/climate-environment/news/the-us-still-in-the-paris-agreement-is-trying-to-decide-its-future/">The US, still in the Paris Agreement, is trying to decide its future</a></p><p></p><p>Despite Donald Trump’s rejection of the Paris Agreement, the US is still very much in the accord and zealously setting the tone of international climate change negotiations. EURACTIV’s media partner, Climate Home News, reports.</p><p></p><p>Negotiators from the other major emitters like China and Russia have seen an opportunity to shape the rulebook for a system which will govern the world’s future energy regime without American influence, and there has been some complaining about the US trying to still influence an accord it says it will withdraw from.</p><p></p><p>Historically, China has sough to ensure that developing countries are treated differently than developed countries in these regimes. But recently Beijing has signalled it may no longer be bound by this “common but differentiated responsibilities” approach, and is ready to take on a greater share of responsibilities.</p><p></p><p>A compromise floated by the EU, backed by the US, which would see a flexible system that gives poorer countries time to comply with a set of rules, has been <a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/climate-environment/news/china-open-to-uniform-climate-rules-sidestepping-old-allies/">tentatively accepted</a> by China. This is just one of the recent steps China has taken which have seen it play a more cooperative role in the UN climate negotiations than previously.</p><p></p><p><a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/climate-environment/news/china-open-to-uniform-climate-rules-sidestepping-old-allies/">China open to ‘uniform’ climate rules, sidestepping old allies</a></p><p></p><p>China has signalled it is open to following “uniform” global climate change rules, shifting from its usual push for a clear division of responsibilities for rich and poor countries. EURACTIV’s media partner, Climate Home News, reports.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Russia remains one of the few countries who have signed the Paris Agreement, but not ratified it. It is unclear what is causing the delay, but in April Deputy Prime Minister Alexey Gordeev said ratification would be concluded by the end of the year.</p><p></p><p>The delay does not represent any reservations about the accord, he said, calling it a “sustainable international legal base” for long-term climate regulation. The country has set a goal of keeping greenhouse gas emissions at the same level for the next 35 years.</p><p></p><p>As countries prepare for this year’s UN climate summit in Chile in December, China and other major emitters will continue to be watched for any sign of wavering on commitment to the deal.

Protectionism ‘à la Green’ appears to be more or less accepted. <a href="https://www.euractiv.fr/section/economie/news/les-partis-francais-veulent-tous-une-taxe-carbone-a-la-frontiere-de-lue/">EURACTIV France reports</a>.</p><p></p><p>Already defended by former French Presidents Sarkozy and Hollande, the idea of a carbon tax at the EU’s borders is typically French and has ended up convincing almost everyone.</p><p></p><p>Everyone benefits from such a tool because it fights pollution and acts as a lever for exporting good environmental practices, but it also appeases more protectionist-leaning parties.</p><p></p><p>Macron was the only head of state who recently opposed opening trade negotiations with the US, the country that wants to withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement. In France, linking international trade with environmental protection is now accepted.</p><p></p><p>“Faced with Trump’s America and Bolsonaro’s Brazil, we have no choice but to impose environmental conditions,” said a candidate of Macron’s party La République en Marche (LREM).</p><p></p><p>But a lot needs to be done to convince European partners of a ‘green protectionism’ with a French touch. In Germany, the conservative Union of CDU and CSU expressed their opposition to a national carbon tax, defending the reform of the European carbon market instead.</p><p></p><p>Sweden also appears viscerally attached to free trade, as even its representatives from the Green party refuse to introduce obstacles on the all-powerful market.</p><p></p><p><a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/emissions-trading-scheme/news/businesseurope-warms-to-macrons-eu-carbon-tariff-idea/">BusinessEurope warms to Macron’s EU carbon tariff idea</a></p><p></p><p>Marking a departure from its existing policy, Europe’s biggest business lobby group said it was discussing a carbon tariff at the EU’s border in order to restore a level playing field with countries like China or the US, which do not impose a pollution constraint on their industries.</p><p></p><p>Marine Le Pen’s Rassemblement National is proposing to “promote localism by making short circuits tax-free and overtaxing globalised imports that are un-ecological.” Although the term European carbon tax is not mentioned, the concept is there.</p><p></p><p>By bringing environmental and border protection closer together, Le Pen’s party has found an angle of attack that allows it to make its programme greener without dropping its nationalist rhetoric.</p><p></p><p>Nicolas Dupont-Aignan from the right-wing Debout la France also included the concept of a carbon tax at the EU’s borders in his programme, in the form of “anti-pollution” customs duties. For him, the objective is to “protect our environment, our jobs and our way of life from imports that are unfair.”</p><p></p><p>On the far right, only François Asselineau is opposed to European taxation, stating that leaving the EU is a priority and any such initiatives are secondary. He also reminded that unanimity required at European level in such matters is currently blocking similar initiatives, with regards to taxing digital giants for instance.</p><p></p><p>A European tax</p><p></p><p>On the other end of the political spectrum, ‘green protectionism’ is also gaining popularity.</p><p></p><p>Left-wing party La France Insoumise, with Manon Aubry leading the European list, considers the European carbon tax to be a tool that can implement “solidarity protectionism” and promote “ecological and local production”. No derogation is envisaged.</p><p></p><p>Greens want “green protectionism” to be based on the introduction of “a socio-environmental tax at the borders which takes into account the real costs of products.”</p><p></p><p>Green party Ecologie-Les-Verts go even further and call for the implementation of “binding sanctions” against those attempting to avoid the ecological transition.</p><p></p><p>Benoît Hamon’s leftist Generation.s party calls for a mechanism fairly close to others on the left, but wants to introduce the idea of progressiveness that will be “indexed to the level of development of each country and emissions.”</p><p></p><p>Finally, the joint list of the French Socialist Party and the leftist Place publique party, considers that this tax will make it possible to “finance transition and development aid policies.”</p><p></p><p>While the concept of green protectionism is popular with many parties, it remains unacceptable for others, such as Les Républicains. In the European Parliament from 2014 to 2019, the right-wing party defended a very liberal European trade policy by voting in favour of free trade agreements.</p><p></p><p>For the Républicains, supporting a European carbon tax is not necessarily associated with the idea of European protectionism; but it is the same idea that is behind proposal 31 of the list led by François Xavier-Bellamy.</p><p></p><p>The party with about 15% of support in the latest polls proposes to set up an “ecological barrier” by implementing anti-pollution custom duties on imports from countries that do not respect our environmental and social standards.”</p><p></p><p>The revenue from this carbon tax at the borders will be allocated to the EU budget earmarked for research and innovation.</p><p></p><p><a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/climate-environment/news/idea-of-establishing-carbon-tax-in-europe-returns-to-election-debate/?_ga=2.41059810.1389526361.1557738459-913603783.1549293072">European carbon tax idea returns to election debate in France</a></p><p></p><p>The French green think-tank La Fabrique Ecologique has published eight environmental proposals to contribute to the European election debate.

If this ever changes, it will probably be the result of a spillover from other parts of the world, Arctic expert Svein Rottem told EURACTIV.com in an interview, in which he spoke about Arctic governance and the EU’s role in the region.</p><p></p><p>Arctic warming at unprecedented rate</p><p></p><p>The diplomatic standoff came as <a href="https://www.amap.no/documents/download/3295/inline">a report</a> from the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme (Amap) sounded the alarm on unprecedented rates of climate change in the region.</p><p></p><p>The Arctic is warming 2.4 times faster than the Northern hemisphere, it said.

What do you think should be the response at global and EU level? Is Europe doing its fair share under the Paris Agreement?</p><p></p><p>Like you said, it’s a problem that should be tackled on a global level. I believe that Europe has taken this issue seriously. European countries have made their commitments, they have signed the Paris climate agreement. And I think that is a good sign. Europe is leading by example.</p><p></p><p>However, Europe represents about 10% of overall CO2 emissions.  So I think that we should encourage others to follow because if they don’t, whatever we do will have very little impact.</p><p></p><p>Isn’t that a bit of a wait-and-see attitude?</p><p></p><p>No, we have to encourage them. But we have no leverage on them – nor China or India. We have to believe that they will show their responsibility. We have to negotiate with them of course. But if you just take the EU, I think we’re doing pretty well.</p><p></p><p>So we shouldn’t do more unless other countries move as well?</p><p></p><p>We should encourage them. But we have very limited leverage on the US, or China or India. We can lead by example, we can try to persuade them that they should follow us, but we can’t force them.</p><p></p><p><a href="https://unfccc.int/news/migration-and-climate-change-need-to-be-tackled-together">The UN says</a> climate change will lead to unprecedented human displacements and expose humanity to increasing levels of insecurity. How should Europe respond to this threat?</p><p></p><p>I think that climate change is probably not the only reason for human displacement. But currently, it is not even the main reason. The main reason for massive migration now is local conflicts, national conflicts, religious conflicts, rather than the impact of climate change. Maybe in the future it will be different but now, I believe it is not the main cause for big shifts in populations.</p><p></p><p>I believe that European politicians are first and foremost responsible for the situation in Europe. They are responsible for the security of European citizens. And when it comes to mass migration, I’m more in favour of a restrictive approach. I think that we should send a clear signal that the number of migrants Europe can accept and absorb is limited. It cannot be millions of people because that will burn our welfare systems, change the very social fabric of our societies and change our demography.</p><p></p><p>In the long term, of course, external policies might help to diminish the impacts of climate change. We can help countries in Africa and Asia to develop cleaner, green technologies. But when it comes to absorbing big chunks of people, I’m rather in favour of a restrictive approach.</p><p></p><p><a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/development-policy/opinion/the-real-wave-of-refugees-is-yet-to-come/">The real wave of refugees is yet to come</a></p><p></p><p>Climate change in Africa is going to be a much stronger driving force for mass migration than political turmoil, writes Tara Shirvani.</p><p></p><p>The European Commission has made the case for Europe to move towards net-zero emissions by 2050, in line with the IPCC report and the Paris Agreement. Do you subscribe to that goal?</p><p></p><p>No, I disagree. I think that aiming for a zero-carbon economy by 2050 goes far beyond our commitments made in the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement doesn’t speak about 2050, it speaks about the second half of the century. And if we go too far, too fast and too insensitively, it will undermine the very fundamentals of Europe’s economies.</p><p></p><p>And this could have a devastating impact on our way of life, on our social consensus and stability. It could lead to a situation where industry will simply outsource production to other countries that would lead to unemployment and social unrest in Europe.</p><p></p><p>So I believe we should stick to our current commitments under the Paris Agreement but we shouldn’t go any further.</p><p></p><p>Do you have another date in mind? Should it be 2060 or 2070?</p><p></p><p>No. I think setting artificial dates or deadlines doesn’t serve to anything good. So let’s stick with the Paris Agreement.</p><p></p><p>Europe is considered a leader in clean technologies. But China is catching up fast and even overtaking Europe on technologies like solar power or <a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/electric-cars/news/china-dwarfs-europe-on-ev-investments-figures-show/">electric vehicles</a>. Some even say China is the “<a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/energy/news/china-seen-as-absolute-winner-of-clean-energy-transition/">absolute winner</a>” of the clean energy transition. What should Europe do to stay ahead in this global race?</p><p></p><p>First, I believe it’s good news that China is progressing on environmentally-friendly technologies. It’s a big polluter still and it probably hasn’t reached its peak, their carbon footprint is still on the rise and will reach its peak probably by 2040. So it’s good news, we should encourage them.</p><p></p><p>On our side, I think we’re still far ahead of China when it comes to quality of life or living standards.</p><p></p><p>However, the Commission has one or two devices to influence the situation. One is the budget. And I would agree to reshuffle budget priorities so that more funds are offered to support science, research and new technologies so that we don’t fall behind other countries.</p><p></p><p>That’s the Horizon Europe programme. Are you in favour of the proposed €100bn budget that the Commission put on the table for 2021-2027? That was a big increase compared to the previous budget. Do you support that?</p><p></p><p>Yes. Basically, yes.</p><p></p><p><a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/climate-strategy-2050/news/europe-ringfences-35-of-research-budget-for-clean-tech/">Europe ringfences 35% of research budget for clean tech</a></p><p></p><p>European Union negotiators struck an agreement late on Tuesday (19 March) to set aside 35% of the bloc’s research funding for climate-friendly technologies, despite ongoing doubts about the overall size of the EU’s future budget after Brexit.</p><p></p><p>Should independence from fossil fuels be listed as one of Europe’s strategic objective? By when?</p><p></p><p>I would disagree with any cap or limit on a European level. Because I believe that the energy mix should stay under the jurisdiction of individual member states. I know that Germany has already announced that they will phase out coal by 2038.</p><p></p><p>But other countries will not do that. My country, the Czech Republic, is quite hesitant because we still have some supplies of brown and black coal. And I think it cannot be done artificially by some kind of European directive.</p><p></p><p>What I believe is that cleaning technologies – filters to separate particles from the air – you can dramatically reduce pollution from coal. We did it I remember over the last 25 years. Some of our industrial installations were heavily polluted in the beginning of the 90s after forty years of communism.</p><p></p><p>And since we started to introduce those new cleaning technologies, we reduced dramatically – by several dozen times – the pollution of the air. So I think that if coal is still used as a fuel – and I don’t believe some countries will accept a very quick phase-out – we can substantially reduce air pollution by introducing some technologies.</p><p></p><p>But the phase-out of coal in itself – do you believe this is a desirable objective?</p><p></p><p>It should be decided on an individual basis by each and every country.</p><p></p><p>The G20 and the G7 countries have pledged to stop subsidising fossil fuels by 2025. But little progress has been achieved since the pledge was first made ten years ago (in 2009). Do you support a firm cut-off date to end fossil fuel subsidies?</p><p></p><p>Again, if it’s socially sustainable. I would agree with stopping subsidies but only if it does not increase living expenses of certain social groups. For instance, pensioners or low-income people. Because if we do that from one day to another, it might cause social problems – for example for people to heat their houses.</p><p></p><p>So it has to be done very carefully, step by step, and taking the social dimension into account.</p><p></p><p>The concept of a just transition to a low-carbon economy was highlighted last year by the “Yellow Vests” protests in France. Have policymakers neglected the social dimension of the energy transition? What do you think should be done about it at EU level?</p><p></p><p>The lesson is very simple and very clear – environmental policy also has to be socially sustainable. Good intentions to have a clean environment as quickly as possible can lead to a situation where politicians create socially unsustainable situations.</p><p></p><p>And this is probably what happened to Mr Macron who was led by his environmental ambitions. He wanted to show France as an environmentally advanced country that cares about the future and that is able to act very swiftly. And very quickly, he created problems for himself and for big parts of the population in his country. And the result was the Yellow Vest protests which lasted months.</p><p></p><p>So everything we do, we always have to take social aspects into account.</p><p></p><p>How would you have done it? Was the tax itself a bad idea or would you have exempted the poor for example?</p><p></p><p>Look, taxation is not a European Union jurisdiction, it’s not a competence of the EU. There is some harmonisation of VAT but consumption tax, income tax…  The European Commission has nothing to do with that.</p><p></p><p><a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/energy/news/clean-energy-transition-is-a-social-policy-issue-poles-insist/">Clean energy transition ‘is a social policy issue’, Poles insist</a></p><p></p><p>The social policy dimension was largely overlooked when the European Union decided energy and climate change objectives for 2030, Poles have warned, calling on policymakers to endorse a “just transition fund” to support the country’s coal phase-out.</p><p></p><p>Moving on to a different topic – agriculture. The European Commission has tried limiting the environmental impact of farming policy with the “green pillar” of the Common Agricultural Policy. Are you happy with the way discussions are going there as part of the CAP reform proposal?</p><p></p><p>We need to take the environmental impact of agriculture into account. Yes, the CAP budget is a very strong instrument, representing more than 40% of the EU’s annual budget. So yes, it has to be used in a smart way, in an environmentally-friendly way.</p><p></p><p>We are in favour of capping direct payments. For instance, in the Czech Republic, all former communist cooperatives were privatised and transformed into those big agricultural complexes. And they are focused purely on production, which is not good for the land, the soil and the environment.</p><p></p><p>So what I would say is that those environmental aspects should be taken much more into account in setting criteria for CAP funding.</p><p></p><p>And frankly speaking, small farms organic farming and family farming are much better able to provide this careful type of agriculture than the big industrial farms.</p><p></p><p>This is actually what the Commission’s proposed reform is about. Does that mean you support the Commission’s CAP reform proposal?</p><p></p><p>Yes, although I would focus more on criteria like land and water supply preservation.  So not just production-oriented goals but also conservation-oriented goals.</p><p></p><p>Farming is the single biggest user of water, ahead of industries like energy. What measures would you recommend to improve the water efficiency of the farming sector?</p><p></p><p>Water should be an important criterion for funding under the CAP. There are various ways to fund some new sensible irrigation systems, reforestation of parts of the land that were artificially deforested.</p><p></p><p>You can encourage a decrease in the use of chemical pesticides and herbicides, and encourage farmers to use bio-degradable types instead. So there are a lot of small things you can do, which combined together can have a great impact. And all of that should be somehow put under the criteria for CAP funding.</p><p></p><p>The Water Framework Directive – do you think it’s working? Should it be reformed in your view?</p><p></p><p>No, I don’t think it should be reformed. I think it should rather be implemented.</p><p></p><p>But the targets on water quality are very tough and, according to some Conservatives in Europe, even impossible to meet.</p><p></p><p>Again, it should be done gradually. As I said before, all methods to purify polluted waters are already there. We’ve known them for 150 years.</p><p></p><p>We know how to deal with non-organic and organic pollution. So when it comes to small farming or family farming, we can encourage them to build some small waste treatment plants. They can be funded from the CAP budget to decrease the pollution of underground waters. All of that should be put as a pre-condition for CAP funding in the future.</p><p></p><p>So you wouldn’t reopen the WFD, you would leave it as it is…?</p><p></p><p>For the moment yes.</p><p></p><p>There is mounting evidence that agriculture – including the use of pesticides – is one of the main culprits behind the dramatic fall in bees and birds populations observed over the past years. What should Europe do to address this? Should the EU ban the use of certain pesticides?</p><p></p><p>I don’t think the EU should ban them. I don’t think we should put any upper limit on them. What I would rather see is to encourage farmers to use them less or not to use them at all.</p><p></p><p>Again, the CAP budget could be a good incentive to encourage that, if we put that in the criteria for CAP funding. So I would use those kinds of incentives rather than just bans or limits.</p><p></p><p>Do you think Europe should do something specifically to address the loss of biodiversity?</p><p></p><p>First of all, changes in biodiversity are a part of natural cycles, to some extent.</p><p></p><p>Except here the fall is dramatic and quite probably linked to human activity…</p><p></p><p>Yes, that’s true. But again, as always: we can do something gradually, we can improve the situation by improving ways and methods of farming and change CAP criteria to support small-scale family farming and organic farming instead of industrial farming. That’s what we can do with the European budget. The rest stays with conservation agencies of national governments.</p><p></p><p>Would you support a global pact on biodiversity similar to what the Paris Agreement did for climate change? Would that sound appealing to you?</p><p></p><p>I don’t know. It sounds nice at first look, but what matters is the content so I’m not sure at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Meat has come under the spotlight because of the vast amounts of water, chemical pesticides and fertilisers that are needed to grow fodder for cattle. Do you think something should be done at EU level to reduce the environmental impact of meat?</p><p></p><p>Rather not. I’m a bit sceptical, this would be going too far for me. It sounds to me like we would be directly trying to influence the lifestyle of individual people. And that is something that might have a damaging impact. If people get the feeling that the EU is trying to interfere in a what they consider a personal matter like how much they eat, what they eat, how much they travel, how many hours per day they should watch TV, or whatever else…</p><p></p><p>These are very personal decisions and if the EU goes this way, it could provoke very anti-European feelings. People would say, ‘Stop it. Don’t tell me what I should have on my table for my lunch or dinner’.</p><p></p><p>Let’s turn to democracy issues now. Hundreds of thousands of young people have taken to the streets over the past months to protest against inaction on climate change. What are the lessons that you draw from these protests?</p><p></p><p>Basically, it’s a good thing that youngsters are getting involved. Young people are catchy. Sometimes they can be radical or revolutionary. It’s their role, we have seen that many times in the past. We have to communicate and engage with them. We should certainly not dismiss them and say they’re too young. That would be very unwise.</p><p></p><p>But we should also explain to them that if we go too far and too fast, we will also endanger other groups in society. And the Yellow Vest protests are a very good example. Because if you compare students and the Yellow Vests, in many respect they promote very contradictory agendas. Youngsters are radically environmental while the Yellow Vests are radically – I wouldn’t say anti-environmental – but they are against measures that would probably be welcomed by Friday marchers.</p><p></p><p>So we should be able to explain to them that if things are done too insensitively, it could trigger an internal war with other age groups in society. It could threaten the social consensus and destabilise society.</p><p></p><p>I know some of them wouldn’t listen and say ‘This is bullshit, we’ve heard that a thousand times. You don’t care because you’re sixty years old’, etc.  I hear this. But the fact that someone is sixty years old doesn’t make that person less valuable than someone who is twenty.</p><p></p><p>You mentioned the need to engage with young people. Do you think there are ways to do that at the European level? The EU is a multi-layered organisation where nation-states and regions also play a role.

Time now to translate those principles into practice, writes Maroš Šefčovič who will be the EU representative at this week’s second Belt and Road Forum in Beijing.</p><p></p><p>Maroš Šefčovič is Vice-President of the European Commission, in charge of the Energy Union.</p><p></p><p>China’s Belt and Road Initiative has received a lot of attention since it was announced back in 2013. Increasingly, this attention has raised questions of unsustainable financing, the quality of infrastructure, and environmental concerns.</p><p></p><p>The European Union is not without its fair share of critics. But connectivity – an admittedly abstract term that requires further explanation or at least illustration – is probably one of the areas in which we have had the most success.</p><p></p><p>Since 1987, millions of Europeans have studied or worked outside of their home country thanks to the Erasmus programme. Over the past five years we have made immeasurable progress in creating an Energy Union, tackling the big energy security and energy transition that we can’t solve within national borders. Since mid-2017, there have been no roaming charges across the EU. A combination of the Schengen area, free movement of people, and the euro currency means that travelling between EU countries, whether for work or for play, is simple.</p><p></p><p>In short, the European Union is about bringing people together and improving the quality of life of our citizens. Connectivity is part of our DNA.</p><p></p><p>The success we have had in connecting people within the EU has proven to be an attractive model for countries beyond our borders. We are currently working with countries in the Western Balkans and Eastern Europe to extend the existing Trans-European Transport Network. Together with Japan, we have created the world’s largest area of safe data transfers, based on a high level of protection of personal data. We are supporting an electricity transmission system to improve electricity access and expand markets in Central and South Asia. And with the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN), the European Union is supporting their own regional integration efforts, particularly in trade facilitation.</p><p></p><p>On the face of it, the Chinese model looks attractive: easy access to finance, rapid building of infrastructure, a ready-made, qualified workforce. Why is it, then, that many countries are increasingly turning to the EU, rather than China, as a partner?</p><p></p><p><a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/central-asia/news/mogherini-unveils-eu-response-to-new-silk-road/">Mogherini unveils EU response to New Silk Road</a></p><p></p><p>EU foreign affairs chief Federica Mogherini announced on Wednesday (19 September) the Commission’s vision on how to better connect Europe and Asia, in what appears to be a reply to China’s Belt and Road initiative, and also an effort to prepare the Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) in October.</p><p></p><p>The answer lies in the European Union’s commitment to the sustainability of infrastructure investments that create quality jobs, protect the environment, and do not leave countries in debt traps.</p><p></p><p>The EU insists on and provides a level-playing field for businesses, good regulation, and an adherence to international norms and standards, with the OECD and the World Bank playing crucial roles. European companies have extraordinary expertise, which can be maximised beyond our borders when they have equal access to tenders. This is not yet the case. The EU has rigorous safety standards, labour laws and environmental commitments that are, for us, not optional. We also have developed flexible financing methods: mixing grants, loans from European and International Financial Institutions such as the European Investment Bank, and private sources of funding. Both borrowers and creditors, official and private, must implement sustainable financing practices.</p><p></p><p>At the recent EU-China Summit (Brussels, 9 April), China signed up to abide by the principles of market rules, transparency, open procurement, a level playing field and fair competition. We also agreed to step up our cooperation on improving connections between Europe and Asia in an economically, socially, fiscally, financially and environmentally sustainable way.</p><p></p><p>These are encouraging signs. As part of our regular discussions on the topic of connectivity (the EU-China Connectivity Platform), we have agreed to look into how and where to improve Eurasian rail networks.</p><p></p><p>More broadly, our joint commitments to implementing the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Paris Climate Agreement, as well as to preserving a cooperative, rules-based and peaceful international system, show that on paper, we share many of the same objectives. The building blocks for positive, mutually-beneficial cooperation between the EU and China on developing our countries and our common neighbourhoods are there.</p><p></p><p>As the European Union’s representative at this week’s second Belt and Road Forum in Beijing, my message will be that now is the time for all of us to translate these principles into practice. If we succeed, China, Europe and the wider world stand to benefit.</p><p></p><p><a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/eu-china/news/china-to-recalibrate-belt-and-road-defend-it-against-western-criticism/">China to recalibrate Belt and Road, defend it against Western criticism</a></p><p></p><p>China is expected to promote a recalibrated version of its Belt and Road initiative at a summit of heads of state this week in Beijing, seeking to allay criticism that its flagship infrastructure policy fuels indebtedness and lacks transparency.</p><p></p><p>文件 EURACOM020190424ef4o0002t</p><p></p><p><img src="data:image/gif;base64,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" /></p><p></p><p><a id="toc12"></a><strong>China open to ‘uniform’ climate rules, sidestepping old allies</strong></p><p></p><p>Sara Stefanini </p><p>958 字</p><p>2018 年 12 月 14 日 14:45</p><p>EurActiv.com</p><p>EURACOM</p><p>英文</p><p>Copyright 2018.

With more support given to them and enhanced capabilities for these developing countries, they will be able to meet their requirements earlier and faster.”</p><p></p><p>The EU is willing to make it voluntary, so countries can choose when to join, as long as there is a clear deadline by which everyone must comply, a developed country negotiator following the talks said. “But we would expect China to start from the beginning.”</p><p></p><p><a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/energy/opinion/to-beat-back-climate-change-the-eu-must-help-china-and-itself/">To beat back climate change, the EU must help China – and itself</a></p><p></p><p>In the fight against climate change, the EU must tackle two gigantic tasks: slash its own emissions, and help China do the same, writes Bernard Durand.</p><p></p><p>The EU and China are hastily drafting new proposals on parts of the “rulebook” under negotiation, at the request of UN secretary general António Guterres on Wednesday, according to the negotiator. As well as the system for ensuring transparency in climate action, they’re discussing rules on financial aid and the scope of national pledges. They plan to deliver the proposals to the COP24 summit’s Polish presidency so it can incorporate them into a draft of the entire text, which is due Friday.</p><p></p><p>Guterres flew to Katowice on Wednesday, amid concerns that the Polish presidency was dragging its feet and political leadership was lacking. He met representatives from Poland, China, the European Commission, India, Canada, Brazil, South Africa and the bloc of developing countries known as the G77 plus China. The secretary general is expected to return on Friday, when the conference is due to end.</p><p></p><p>After agreeing to work with China, the EU also held a series of meetings on Wednesday and Thursday to shore up support for its flexible system of applying the rules. Those included Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the US, Mexico, Japan, Switzerland, Norway and some African, Caribbean and Pacific countries, the developed country negotiator said.</p><p></p><p>The aim: “To have a critical mass of developed and developing countries, to support one system of transparency when we go to the plenary on Friday.”</p><p></p><p><a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/climate-environment/news/china-eu-reaffirm-paris-climate-commitment-vow-more-cooperation/">China, EU reaffirm Paris climate commitment, vow more cooperation</a></p><p></p><p>China and the European Union on Monday reaffirmed their commitment to the Paris climate change pact and called other signatories to do the same, saying action against rising global temperatures had become more important than ever.</p><p></p><p>The way the rules are applied to countries could determine how effective they are in making sure countries fulfil their pledges under the Paris climate agreement. Loose requirements for tracking and reporting greenhouse gas emissions, for example, will make it difficult to assess progress or pick out the laggards.</p><p></p><p>Xie’s comments on Thursday broke away from China’s traditional allies: Brazil, South Africa and India. This group – known as the Basic group of emerging economies – had to date been the loudest in demanding a clearer division of labour, or bifurcation.</p><p></p><p>“There has to be some degree of flexibility – a reassertion of the differentiated approach, if you like – and the allowance made for developing countries,” South African tourism minister Tokozile Xasa said in a press conference on Wednesday. The push for “equal treatment” from some countries would represent a backslide on the Paris Agreement, which recognises the differences in capabilities, Xasa added.</p><p></p><p>A US state department spokesperson declined to comment on the kind of system it would support.</p><p></p><p>A burst of shuttle diplomacy on Thursday came amid deepening concern about the progress of negotiations. Many expect the summit to run over into the weekend. Poland’s COP24 president, Michał Kurtyka, made a plea to ministers on Thursday afternoon, after hearing a stocktake of their progress on specific pieces of the text.</p><p></p><p>“I ask you to move forward as soon as possible… so we can achieve a meaningful outcome tonight,” he said. “We do not have the comfort of time, but we have the will and we have the power to achieve an outcome here in Katowice.”</p><p></p><p>The main concern for negotiators was that Poland had yet to deliver a full draft of the rules – making it hard for ministers to decide where they were willing to make trade-offs. Plus, many of the open questions were still extremely complex. “There are risks around ministers dealing with technical issues; that things could be weakened if they haven’t been fully briefed,” a British source said. “So we’re not there yet.”</p><p></p><p><a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/china/news/climate-action-cements-renewed-eu-china-relations/">EU, China turn from trade to climate action to cement relations</a></p><p></p><p>The EU and China confirmed today (2 June) their decision to step up their cooperation against climate change.

Public policy must therefore clear the way for sustainable investments from the private sector, <a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2018/11/06/2018-ecofin-climate-finance-conclusions/">they said</a>.</p><p></p><p>The European Union funneled €20.4 billion ($23bn) in public money towards limiting climate change and adapting to its effects in 2017, making it the largest contributor in the world, the ministers noted. They reaffirmed the bloc’s commitment to continue raising public and private climate finance as part of the developed world’s pledge to shore up $100bn per year by 2020.</p><p></p><p>Strong transparency rules underpinning the Paris climate agreement will help keep track of the progress countries make towards their pledges, including for financial aid, the ministers stressed.</p><p></p><p>The transparency framework is one of the most contentious issues in negotiations ahead of next month’s Cop24 summit, where countries must agree on rules for meeting the Paris Agreement. The US and EU want to impose strong reporting and monitoring rules across the developed and developing worlds.

EurActiv.com All Rights Reserved. </p><p></p><p>As Poland readies itself to welcome the world in December, the man tasked with organising the COP24 Katowice summit told EURACTIV how preparations are going for what is likely to be make-or-break climate talks for the Paris Agreement.</p><p></p><p>Michał Kurtyka is secretary of state in Poland’s ministry of environment and is government plenipotentiary for the COP24 presidency. He responded to written questions.</p><p></p><p>Do you have a specific set of goals for the Katowice summit and how confident are you that you will achieve them?</p><p></p><p>There are several challenges we are facing at COP24 in Katowice. Given this conference is about operationalising the Paris Agreement, which provided us with a framework, but did not crunch the details of how to actually get to the goals the global community set out for itself, I could enumerate here a whole list of technical details which must be finalised in various decisions. But let me focus on two areas I see as particularly sensitive, and which will require political guidance in December. One is the issue of differentiation.</p><p></p><p>We are talking about how to move forward as a global community in achieving the goals of the agreement, implementing a system which takes into account differences between countries. This concerns the standards for transparent reporting by all countries and information pertaining to their contributions. Second, there is an issue of reporting on finance provided in the past and to be provided, so that the recipient countries commit to ambitious mitigation action having a reasonable degree of certainty they can pull their plans off the ground.</p><p></p><p>I just returned from New York where we hosted informal consultations on these and other issues with a representative group of countries from all negotiating groups. I am reassured there is a will among the Parties to deliver the Katowice outcome. We are hard at work and we will do all in our power to facilitate this delivery.</p><p></p><p>Katowice, a small city compared to previous COP hosts like Paris, is set to host diplomats and negotiators from across the world in December. What was the reasoning behind the decision to use a former mining centre as the venue for such an important climate summit?</p><p></p><p>We hosted the UN climate conferences in Poland twice before. Poznan hosted COP 14 and Warsaw hosted COP19. Both cities are smaller than Paris and both COPs delivered good results. The very notion of the intended nationally determined contributions (the INDCs) was coined at the meeting in Warsaw. On symbolism, we are of the view that if a much-needed transformation is to take place, those affected by it the most must be invited to the conversation.</p><p></p><p>In any situation in life, this is a logical approach, as it should be in the climate change policy arena. Katowice is the place where climate policy will dramatically alter the way of life of large communities. It is only fair to recognise that. This is why I made the topic of just transition prominent during our Presidency this year.</p><p></p><p><a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/energy-environment/news/german-coal-commission-member-if-we-dont-come-up-with-a-roadmap-itll-be-a-disaster/">German coal commission member: If we don’t come up with a roadmap, it'll be a disaster</a></p><p></p><p>Ahead of Germany’s coal commission meeting on Tuesday (18 September), one of its members explained to EURACTIV what is behind the meaning of ‘structural economic change’, which the newly appointed institution has to deal with. </p><p></p><p>How much planning has been put into this presidency of the COP and how important do you assess its role in delivering the aims of this particular summit?</p><p></p><p>Admittedly, our team was put in place later than usual. We are, however, quite determined to make sure that the Polish Presidency delivers a good outcome, as it has done in the past. To put things in perspective, every time Poland is set to take the lead of the global process there is scepticism. I will let the fruit of the conference speak for itself. Long held opinions are usually hard to change no matter the argumentation.</p><p></p><p>The lead-up to COP24 has been hectic. Talks in Bangkok failed to completely narrow down all the options that leaders will pick from in Katowice and an extra day has been added to the summit. Is that the key resource in this process: time?</p><p></p><p>I strongly disagree with the notion that the Bangkok talks failed. They were very helpful in injecting momentum into the process and resulted in a strong mandate for the officers presiding over the respective strands of the discussions to produce draft textual proposals. Obviously, there is still a lot of work ahead of us but we probably achieved more progress in one week in Bangkok in September than in two weeks in Bonn in May. The options for the ministers are always distilled only during the COP. Parties do not let go of their positions earlier than that. It is not realistic to expect that. What’s more important is that the chief negotiators gain a good understanding of where the discussion is going and this is happening as we speak.</p><p></p><p><a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/climate-environment/news/lack-of-climate-action-ambition-from-governments-balanced-by-pivotal-non-state-actors/">Lack of climate action ambition from governments balanced by pivotal non-state actors</a></p><p></p><p>San Francisco’s Global Climate Action Summit ended on 14 September with non-state actors sending a call to action to governments ahead of the crucial COP24 in December, while highlighting their pivotal role in reducing emissions and reaching climate targets. </p><p></p><p>The presidency of the Paris COP also raced against time to put together what would eventually be the Paris Agreement. They largely achieved this through informal negotiations on the sidelines and a willingness to be flexible. Does your presidency intend to follow a similar approach, if needed? </p><p></p><p>We already held and will hold further informal consultations. We have an experienced team in place who know the process and its actors. I have paid visits to China, India, South Africa, Singapore, Norway, Germany, France, Canada and the US. I met with ASEAN and the BASIC countries. I am on my way to the Middle East. There is much in the planning and we are hard at work. The informal approach is very useful and must complement the formal process.</p><p></p><p>Three years on from Paris, the agreement looks shaky at times, given Donald Trump’s decision to pull out when possible, Australia’s eroding ambition and the chance that Brazil’s next leader may decide to nix it too. Does that give this COP even more added importance?</p><p></p><p>I see the role of the successive Presidencies as that of stewards of hard work which took many, many years. We are the ones responsible for sending it safe and sound on its way into the future. The Paris Agreement is historic, but only in Katowice will we show the world it is implementable. This is important.</p><p></p><p><a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/climate-environment/news/australias-new-pm-risks-climate-trade-off-with-eu/">Australia's new PM risks climate trade-off with EU</a></p><p></p><p>Australia’s new prime minister will not walk away from the Paris climate agreement, although his new policies now make it unlikely the country will meet its emissions reduction goal. Ongoing trade talks with the EU could also hinge on how climate policy continues to develop.</p><p></p><p>Is Poland alone in hosting this COP or can we consider this a European effort? To what extent have other countries lent support or assistance?</p><p></p><p>COP14 and COP19 were a global effort, as all other conferences before, in between and after. Every COP is an effort of all Parties. In the run-up to any COP, a number of governmental and non-governmental actors assist by hosting discussions in various configurations and we are grateful for that. Any effort which brings the Parties’ understanding closer to a landing ground is valuable. Poland as the Presidency of the global climate process fulfils a role of a proud host and a keen assistant to the final delivery. COP 24 is no different in this respect.</p><p></p><p>The European Commission plans to unveil its 2050 long-term climate strategy either just before or at COP itself. Is this good timing in your opinion and do you think this forward-planning from the EU will help the effort needed in December to finalise the rulebook?</p><p></p><p>These two issues can be treated in a different manner. The EU, in light of its internal legislation and based on the impulse given by the European Council in March 2018, will be developing a long term strategy based on national plans.

Now his environment minister has resigned, he has to put words into action, writes Jennifer Morgan.</p><p></p><p>Jennifer Morgan is the Executive Director of Greenpeace International.</p><p></p><p>The summer of 2018, particularly in Europe, will be remembered as a climate change tipping-point. Extended droughts, fires and heat waves – impacts that were projected to happen far into the future – happened in 2018. Few countries in Europe have been spared. <a href="https://www.businessinsider.de/photos-greece-europe-fires-2018-7?r=US&amp;IR=T">Ten European countries, northern and southern, suffered</a>.</p><p></p><p>The costs to people and society are immense. While Europe is a wealthy continent that is better able to manage such costs, we are only just beginning to understand what those costs mean for our future.</p><p></p><p>It’s at times like this when we ache for real climate leadership and courage – someone who will step up and lead the political charge to transform our economies into the clean, safe and prosperous ones it is so clear people and our planet need.</p><p></p><p>Up to now, French President Emmanuel Macron has been trying hard to claim the mantle of ‘climate leadership’. He has made bold statements about implementing the Paris climate agreement, hosted a One Planet Summit and made promises to move France to the electric car by 2040. He also brought in a very credible and serious Environment Minister, Nicolas Hulot.</p><p></p><p><a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/climate-environment/opinion/room-for-hope-at-macrons-one-planet-summit/">Room for hope at Macron’s One Planet Summit</a></p><p></p><p>French President Emmanuel Macron will this week welcome over 50 leaders from around the world, two years after the adoption of the Paris Agreement. Leaders and international financial institutions must seize this opportunity to ramp up their ambition and end support for fossil fuels, writes Maeve McLynn.</p><p></p><p>However, France’s greenhouse gas emissions are increasing. It is failing to meet its renewable energy targets and is dragged down by a crippled nuclear industry. There is no mobility plan reliant on clean public transport and the agriculture sector remains dominated by a toxic agroindustry. Macron’s Environment Minister has now resigned, frustrated by his political isolation and the influence of outdated and dirty industries on government decisions which are often short-sighted and contradictory.</p><p></p><p>Now truly an emperor with no clothes, what would it take to make President Macron the climate leader the world now so desperately needs?</p><p></p><p>Real climate leadership for Macron means committing now to the transformation of the electricity sector to 100% renewable energy, modernising and decentralising infrastructure, which requires a phase-out of nuclear and coal. It means launching a mobility system that is centred around public transportation and renewable electricity-powered vehicles. It means phasing out pesticides and creating an agricultural sector based on sustainable practices.</p><p></p><p>Most of all, President Macron must use his influence to ensure Germany and the rest of Europe deliver on commitments made under the Paris Agreement. This means delivering a deal that boosts EU climate action. European governments can and must do much more to tackle climate change and stimulate similar pledges from other major powers, particularly China. European progress cannot happen without France, given its importance and influence, particularly with German Chancellor Angela Merkel.</p><p></p><p>After WWII Europe decided on a Schuman Plan to revitalise its economy and bring peace. That plan was based on coal and steel. Today, in the midst of another crisis, Macron must lead a new Schuman Plan for Europe – one based on solar and wind energy. Such leadership would not only put pressure on German Chancellor Angela Merkel to recommit to climate leadership, but also send a signal globally that he is not only about words, and is ready to do the hard work to get it done.</p><p></p><p><a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/climate-environment/news/france-raises-its-environmental-game-with-ambitious-new-climate-package/">France raises its environmental game with ambitious new climate package</a></p><p></p><p>With plans to make France carbon neutral and phase out fossil fuel-powered vehicles by 2040, Paris is showing new levels of ambition when it comes to the environment.

So wipe the tears, stop the whining and turn over a new page. The US has embarked on a new journey, and the EU should do the same, writes Shada Islam.</p><p></p><p>Shada Islam is director of Europe and geopolitics at Friends of Europe, a think tank that connects people, stimulates debate and triggers change to create a more inclusive, sustainable and forward-looking Europe.</p><p></p><p>Europe has already started to woo new partners, tackle fresh challenges and explore roads less-travelled. But more can be done.</p><p></p><p>First, it should be clear by now that America really is not into Europe anymore. For US President Donald Trump, it is America first, dictators second and old friends and allies last.</p><p></p><p>Second, loud headlines about the demise of the “West” and collapse of the rules-based multilateral order need to be put in perspective.</p><p></p><p>The US is undoubtedly in retreat from its global commitments while Asia’s rising powers, with China in the lead, are ratcheting up their worldwide influence and clout.</p><p></p><p>For proof, look no further than the G7 meeting in Canada which ended in insulting tweets and counter-tweets, while the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit in Qingdao at almost the same time appeared to herald a new era of cooperation among the once-warring leaders of Russia, China and India.</p><p></p><p>Beware of hasty conclusions, however. The old order is certainly unravelling and a new one is emerging. But, Europe – provided it plays its cards right – can still play an important role in crafting the new rules of the game.</p><p></p><p>With its unique story of peace, reconciliation and integration, Europe is and will always be more than a mere member of an America-led “Western alliance”.</p><p></p><p>Also, European markets, investments, technology, exports – and smart power – continue to resonate across the world. European values may not sit well with many Asian (or indeed European) governments but they are important to Asia’s ordinary folk.</p><p></p><p>Significantly, even as they become more self-confident and assertive about voicing their aspirations and concerns, the rising powers are not ready – yet – to completely jettison the old playbook.</p><p></p><p>China’s President Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi used the SCO summit to underline their readiness to abide by world trade rules.</p><p></p><p>In addition, while Asia’s ascending and fast-growing nations may be waxing lyrical about the “Shanghai Spirit, their leaders still face an abundance of challenges at home and in relations to each other.</p><p></p><p>Ensuring inclusive and sustainable growth, tackling illegal immigration, terrorism, inequalities and combatting climate change require international cooperation.</p><p></p><p>The EU is already shifting gear. The strides made in European defence and security cooperation are important. EU efforts to salvage the Iran nuclear deal and push ahead with the Paris climate agreement and safeguard the multilateral trade system may yet save the day.</p><p></p><p>It is now time to move from crisis management mode to the much more challenging task of fashioning a modern and up-to-date multilateral order, one which is no longer West-focused but reflects changed dynamics and patterns of global power.</p><p></p><p>In simple terms: for Europeans, it was all about basking in the glory of a powerful transatlantic alliance. It is now time to talk about Eurasian cooperation instead.</p><p></p><p>The reflection has already begun – albeit under another heading. In October this year, 53 European and Asian leaders will meet in Brussels for the 12th Asia Europe Meeting (ASEM), a platform for Eurasian cooperation which has been under-valued and under-utilised in the past.</p><p></p><p>That needs to change. The upcoming ASEM meeting which brings together members of the G7, the G20, the SCO (and other bigger and smaller groupings) can help ease current uncertainties by shining the spotlight on three key areas.</p><p></p><p>First, the summit can start discussions on defining a new 21st Century cooperative rules-based multilateral order which is co-created and co-designed by Europe and leading Asian powers.</p><p></p><p>ASEM is perfect for such a conversation given the diversity of its membership which includes “like-minded” nations like Australia, New Zealand, Japan and Korea but also China, India and Southeast Asian nations.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, the ASEM summit should define new norms and standards for sustainable global connectivity projects covering infrastructure as well as trade, institutions and people-to-people ties.</p><p></p><p>While China’s Belt and Road Initiative captures the most attention and criticism, other ASEM members, including the EU, Japan, India and South Korea are engaged in similar plans to connect and link up through better and quicker rail, plane and maritime routes.

While Sweden came out on top for putting in place domestic policies above and beyond the requirements of the Paris Agreement, it was urged to do more to tackle its high energy consumption per capita.</p><p></p><p>The Czech Republic, while scoring low on climate targets, has signalled its intention to reduce lignite consumption by 73% by 2040, which CAN Europe hailed as “a step in the right direction,” despite the country’s lack of any clear plan to phase out coal.</p><p></p><p>And while Croatia, Romania and Greece overachieved on their 2020 climate and energy targets, they only did so because their objectives were “set too low and are easy to reach,” CAN Europe said.</p><p></p><p>“Unfortunately, most countries that advocate for more ambitious policies for the future are currently lagging behind in achieving targets for 2020 and reducing carbon emissions,” the report said.</p><p></p><p><a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/energy/interview/german-think-tank-eus-32-renewable-energy-target-still-unambitious/">German think-tank: EU’s 32% renewable energy target ’still unambitious’</a></p><p></p><p>The 32% renewable energy target agreed by EU negotiators last week is still “much lower” than what would be needed to reach the Paris goals on climate change, argue experts at the Heinrich Böll Foundation in Germany.</p><p></p><p>The report was published at the start of a busy week for climate diplomacy.

This is out of respect for the authors and to give them the time and space to finish writing before making the work public. For these reasons, the IPCC does not comment on the contents of draft reports while work is still ongoing,” the statement reads.</p><p></p><p>The IPCC is the leading international body for the assessment of climate change. It was established by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) in 1988 to provide a clear scientific view on the current state of knowledge in climate change and its potential environmental and socio-economic impacts.</p><p></p><p>They are of crucial relevance in international climate negotiations, where diplomats have to juggle extremely diverse topics, exponential and sparse scientific knowledge, and diplomatic struggles that are sometimes based more on positions of principle and ideas.</p><p></p><p>At the local level as well, the credibility of the IPCC’s conclusions plays a role in the implementation of climate-compatible public policies and climate projects, which often still conflict with other perspectives, such as industrial development.</p><p></p><p>This is why Bert Metz, Fellow at the European Climate Foundation and former Co-chair of the IPCC Working Group III on mitigation on climate change, emphasises the importance of urgently limiting temperature increase to 1.5C in order to reduce climate risks.</p><p></p><p>“As was clear from a number of scientific studies that were published recently, there is now a lot of evidence that the risks of climate change are significantly lower when temperature increase is limited to 1.5°C, compared to an increase of 2°C. This holds for the overall economic damage, loss of biodiversity, health impacts of fossil fuel associated air pollution, sea level rise- particularly over the next hundreds of years – and many other aspects of society and nature,” he said.</p><p></p><p>He also highlighted what he sees as the current inadequacy of governments’ national contribution to reducing greenhouse gases emission.</p><p></p><p>“As already was clearly shown in last year’s Emissions Gap Report from UN Environment, the current pledges made by countries in Paris- the so called NDCs- are totally insufficient to help meet the Paris goals of limiting temperature increase to well below 2°C, let alone 1.5°C. They would likely lead to an increase of more than 3°C.

For example, the JEFTA (EU agreement with Japan) refers to the Paris Climate Agreement.</p><p></p><p>In a <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/transparency/regdoc/rep/1/2017/EN/COM-2017-654-F1-EN-MAIN-PART-1.PDFhttps:/ec.europa.eu/transparency/regdoc/rep/1/2017/EN/COM-2017-654-F1-EN-MAIN-PART-1.PDF">follow-up report</a> published in November, the Commission points out that free-trade agreements have already pointed to positive effects, such as encouraging a better application of ILO conventions in partner countries.</p><p></p><p><a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/energy-environment/news/calls-grow-for-green-clause-in-eu-trade-deals/?_ga=2.181803431.1038194219.1521446560-968745153.1517906027">Calls grow for ‘green clause’ in EU trade deals</a></p><p></p><p>There is widespread consensus on the need to level the playing field for European companies confronted with environmental and social dumping from foreign competitors. Just how hard the EU should hit on wrongdoers remains a major sticking point, however.</p><p></p><p>However, for many NGOs such as Foodwatch, the guarantees are not enough. In a <a href="https://www.foodwatch.org/fileadmin/foodwatch_international/campaigns/TTIP/2018-02_Trade-at-any-cost_report-foodwatch-powershift_EN.pdf">report</a> published in early February, Foodwatch points out that the provisions on sustainable development and the precautionary principle are included in the “Trade and Sustainable Development” chapter (without binding control mechanisms).</p><p></p><p>However, the binding chapters called TBT (Technical Barriers to Trade) and SPS (Sanitary and Phytosanitary) do not mention sustainable development or the precautionary principle.</p><p></p><p>“These chapters refer to the WTO rules, but the WTO does not guarantee the precautionary principle,” Karine Jacquemart, the head of the NGO, told a conference at the Printemps de l’Economie on 20 March.</p><p></p><p>Uncertainty over control mechanisms</p><p></p><p>The Commission points out that guarantees exist in the agreements to monitor compliance with the international commitments to which they refer. The agreement provides for a “Committee on sustainable development” to examine issues over the “Trade and Sustainable Development” chapter.</p><p></p><p>In case of disagreements between states over these issues, a dispute resolution mechanism allows for the establishment of a panel of experts. The Commission also relies on the monitoring by civil society via a forum composed of civil society representatives.</p><p></p><p>However, according to a report on CETA commissioned by the French government and published last September by an independent committee, there are still some uncertainties over the scope of these mechanisms.</p><p></p><p>According to the independent committee, the CETA remains silent on the “way in which the Committee on Sustainable Development can come up with a solution that benefits all contracting parties”.</p><p></p><p>The report also highlights that the expert panel’s recommendations are not binding, but could have an impact as it is made public. For the civil society forum, the committee finds it “regrettable that the agreement does not specify how the assessments made could be taken into account in order to (…) better adapt the agreement to the objective of sustainable development”.</p><p></p><p>However, contrary to Foodwatch, the report believes that the precautionary principle is applied in the CETA although “the lack of explicit citation of the term (…) creates uncertainty over the possible contestation by Canada”.</p><p></p><p><a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/economy-jobs/news/malmstrom-clashes-with-greenpeace-over-eu-japan-deals-green-credentials/?_ga=2.107314306.1038194219.1521446560-968745153.1517906027">Malmström clashes with Greenpeace over EU-Japan deal's 'green' credentials</a></p><p></p><p>EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmström made the case on Monday (26 June) for new trade deals with foreign partners, as fresh criticism emerged about ongoing talks with Japan.</p><p></p><p>Possible Improvements</p><p></p><p>According to the economist Catherine Schubert, these shortcomings do not mean that CETA and new generation agreements should be abandoned. “It is possible to find concrete steps to take to advance in the approach of these treaties”, she said.</p><p></p><p>The independent committee also put forward proposals for improvement, such as setting up a monitoring committee at the national level.</p><p></p><p>“A Political Tool”</p><p></p><p>The head of the Brussels office of the Robert Schuman Foundation, Charles de Marcilly, pointed out that the EU is often the strong part of these agreements, which allows it to impose its standards.</p><p></p><p>“The EU represents a market of more than 500 million consumers.

EurActiv.com All Rights Reserved. </p><p></p><p>It’s time for the G20 to give energy efficiency the respect it deserves, writes Rachel Kyte.</p><p></p><p>Rachel Kyte is CEO and Special Representative to the UN Secretary-General for <a href="https://www.seforall.org/">Sustainable Energy for All</a>.</p><p></p><p>Representing 80% of the global economy, what the leading industrialised and emerging economies of the G20 do – individiually and collectively – matters.</p><p></p><p>More than two years into the implementation period of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and two years past the Paris Climate Agreement, doubling down on energy efficiency is the obvious step in an energy transition that aims to decarbonise the global economy.</p><p></p><p>Despite providing cost-effective savings and environmental and health benefits, energy efficiency efforts among the G20 are lagging. While China, India and Mexico have made ambitious broad changes – and the US and EU countries have made impressive gains in parts of their economies – overall progress is not at the pace needed to double the global rate of energy efficiency improvements by 2030, as called for by the SDGs.</p><p></p><p>More needs to be done to achieve this globally-supported goal that will help end poverty, protect the planet and ensure prosperity for all.</p><p></p><p>Those who work on energy efficiency complain that the contributions it can make to achieve our climate and development goals are often overlooked. But the benefits are real, touching individuals and families across the world.</p><p></p><p>The countries hosting the Presidency of the G20 the past two years – China in 2016 and Germany in 2017 – have rightly placed energy efficiency at the top of their energy agendas. And it is paying off. In 2016, German consumers saved nearly $580 per capita due to home- and vehicle-related efficiency programs. In China, the average household saw a 25% drop in its energy bills due to efficiency efforts, as well a 27% drop in smog pollution for Beijing-area residents. That’s fewer asthma attacks and hospital visits.</p><p></p><p>Argentina, which is hosting the G20 Presidency this year, is also seizing the opportunity. It is focusing on energy efficiency standards for social housing, strengthening mandatory efficiency standards for appliances and developing efficiency labels for light-duty vehicles.</p><p></p><p>What would it take to get the entire G20, and its lion share of the global economy, to become an energy efficiency powerhouse?</p><p></p><p>First, G20 countries need to re-size their ambitions to meet the 2.6% annual improvement targets necessary to achieve the 2030 efficiency goal. This means at least tripling and, in some countries, increasing by six-fold their energy efficiency investments.</p><p></p><p>One place to start is by recognizing that within the G20 there are strong efficiency practices—they’re just not everywhere. There is a wide performance gap, with some G20 countries using 80% more energy, on average, to run their economies compared to Denmark, widely viewed to be “best in class” in energy efficiency for an advanced economy. Using positive deviance as a management tool, all G20 countries can set comparable goals and map out steps to achieve them. And the best can set the next benchmark of high performance.</p><p></p><p>Last year’s <a href="https://www.seforall.org/content/rise-sustainable-energy-policies">RISE report</a>, produced by the World Bank and supported by <a href="http://www.seforall.org">Sustainable Energy for All</a>, highlights the importance of strong efficiency policies and standards in driving improvements. Yet, new data show a noticeable slowdown in implementation of new policies by G20 countries in 2016 and 2017.</p><p></p><p>Second, the G20 needs to strengthen policies at home and support them in other countries. The International Energy Agency (IEA) has shown that more than two-thirds of global energy use is still not covered by efficiency mandates. All countries should be strengthening and expanding policy coverage with mandatory codes and standards. These standards should align with the Paris Climate Agreement and the SDGs. They should provide the conditions for the private sector to innovate the super-efficiency we need now and in the future.</p><p></p><p>Third, energy efficiency has to be on equal footing with other types of energy planning in national policymaking. Conversations about energy security, renewable energy and modernisation must include energy efficiency as a key form of infrastructure.</p><p></p><p>Fourth, energy transition discussions are often overly focused on power generation and not on other uses of energy. The transport sector is on the cusp of its own revolution—burgeoning electric vehicle demand, for example—but in order for efficiency in transportation to allow all people to breathe clean air, commute to work affordably and move goods and services efficiently, we need aggressive, integrated policymaking and engagement, especially from city leaders.</p><p></p><p>Fifth, and on the same theme of uses of energy, heating and cooling technologies must be a focus of robust efficiency goals. Key in this regard is the recent ratification of the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol. It requires a major phasedown of high-polluting refrigerants (known as HFCs) used in cooling equipment. The importance of cooling to protect food supplies, preserve medicines or simply keep cool in ever-hotter cities and towns cannot be overstated. Getting everyone affordable, super-efficient, HFC-free cooling is an ambition worthy of the G20.</p><p></p><p>Finally, financing energy efficiency has seen little innovation in recent years. Paying companies and their bankers to be more efficient has had its successes, but this model isn’t achieving scale and it doesn’t offer the most efficient use of public funds. It’s time for a rethink.</p><p></p><p>Energy efficiency reform takes time but its impact is immense. Ask Mexican households whose energy bills are less today compared to 30 years ago, even with all the additional services they are getting from energy use today. In racing terms, energy efficiency is a marathon and the G20 is already off the pace. The question is this: Can G20 pick up the pace and, as the best marathoners do, sprint as well? This is the challenge for G20 countries in 2018. They must lead from the front and sprint to win.</p><p></p><p>Sustainable Energy for All is the global platform working to achieve universal access to sustainable energy, as a contribution to a cleaner, just and prosperous world for all.

EurActiv.com All Rights Reserved. </p><p></p><p>Europe has to decide what to do in case the US makes good on its threat to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal and re-impose sanctions on Iran. The alternative is to agree to tighter terms proposed by Washington that could hit European companies.</p><p></p><p>The EU says it fully supports the nuclear deal and some analysts and MEPs say it should not cave in to pressure from Washington. Others, however, say it should comply with demands from its biggest security partner.</p><p></p><p>In light of growing concerns in the business community, an EU spokesperson told EURACTIV.com that the bloc always seeks to protect the interests of its companies.</p><p></p><p>“We would not speculate about hypothetical situations. The EU always seeks to protect the legitimate interests of its economic operators,” the spokesperson said when asked whether the bloc has a contingency plan to protect European investors if Washington ultimately decides to pull out of the deal reached in July 2015.</p><p></p><p>After almost two years of delicate negotiations, China, France, Russia, the UK, US and Germany and the EU – known as the P5+1 – agreed with Tehran in Vienna on the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) to rein in Iran’s nuclear programme in exchange for relief from nuclear-related economic sanctions.</p><p></p><p>But the Trump administration has called the deal an “embarrassment” that is not in the US national interest and needs to be “corrected”.</p><p></p><p>“This is the last chance… I hereby call on key European countries to join with the United States in fixing significant flaws in the deal, countering Iranian aggression, and supporting the Iranian people. If other nations fail to act during this time, I will terminate our deal with Iran,” the US president warned last month.</p><p></p><p>“If Iran does not comply with any of these [new] provisions, American nuclear sanctions would automatically resume.”</p><p></p><p>For its part, the EU has <a href="https://eeas.europa.eu/headquarters/headquarters-homepage/38156/iran-eu-committed-full-implementation-nuclear-deal_en">stated</a> it will remain “fully committed” to implementing the nuclear deal. Brussels has stood by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which has conducted numerous inspections in Iran and said that the country has complied with all its commitments.</p><p></p><p>“It is a deal that prevented a nuclear arms race in the Middle East, next to us. That brought security in the region and to young people in the country. That was the European way and it was thanks to us because we were the mediator,” EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini  said recently.</p><p></p><p><a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/defence-policy/news/mogherini-lashes-out-at-trump-says-eu-is-the-only-credible-global-power/">Mogherini lashes out at Trump, says EU is the ‘only credible’ global power</a></p><p></p><p>EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini launched an attack against US President Donald Trump on Wednesday (18 October), without directly naming him, claiming that isolation in foreign policy leads nowhere and that the EU is currently the “only credible and predictable” global power.</p><p></p><p>But the EU business sector is anxious that American sanctions would affect EU companies that operate in Iran and also have commercial activities in the US.</p><p></p><p>EU businesses worried</p><p></p><p>Luisa Santos, director for international relations at BusinessEurope, which represents EU-based enterprises, said that the business community backs the nuclear deal.</p><p></p><p>“If one of the partners decides to consider putting into question that agreement, therefore deciding on additional sanctions on Iran that do not take into account what the other partners are doing, that creates a problem for us,” Santos said.</p><p></p><p>She added that the problem lies in the extraterritorial nature of the US sanctions, under which companies that are in any way involved with the US might be affected even if the EU maintains the current situation.</p><p></p><p>“It’s a factor of risk that we have to take into account,” she insisted.</p><p></p><p>Need for contingency planning</p><p></p><p>According to Steven Blockmans, the head of EU foreign policy at the Centre for European Policy Studies (CEPS), the EU will be “forced” to act independently of the US on JCPOA.</p><p></p><p>“Just like it had to do when the US walked away from the Paris climate agreement, UNESCO, and the Middle East peace process by recognising Jerusalem as the capital of Israel,” said Blockmans.</p><p></p><p>Blockmans noted that the EU institutions, France, Germany and the UK should stand firm in support of the principle of ‘pacta sunt servanda’, one of the cornerstones of international law.</p><p></p><p>“The EU should remind the US that it should stick to its own commitments and not undermine the authority of the UN Security Council, which signed off on the nuclear deal by including the text in an annex to a legally binding resolution.”</p><p></p><p>As for the economic implications, Blockmans stressed that if and when new US sanctions come into effect, EU companies will face a binary choice: doing business in Iran or continuing operations with a US dimension.</p><p></p><p>“Without European protection of their investments against the long arm of US sanctions, companies are likely to stop trading with Iran. This is not in the interest of the EU and its member states. They should, therefore, start contingency planning,” the CEPS expert said.</p><p></p><p>The same view is shared by Knut Fleckenstein, the vice-president of the Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, who believes that the bloc must be prepared for US foreign policy priorities to have an impact on European policy.</p><p></p><p>“The EU definitely needs a ‘plan B’ to protect EU companies in this worst-case scenario. It is the Commission’s duty to prepare such a plan and to have it ready to hand when needed. Of course, I hope the plan never needs to be applied and that President Trump re-thinks his current approach.”</p><p></p><p>The German MEP stressed the deal’s significance for security in the region, as well as in Europe, but warned that the EU has its eyes closed to what is currently happening in Iran.</p><p></p><p>“It must not be ‘either/or’ but ‘both’. We need progress on human rights issues and a fully implemented nuclear deal that has already been proven to be successful. However, Iran-related concerns lie outside the JCPOA and should be addressed separately and in the regional context.”</p><p></p><p><a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/european-external-action-service/news/eu-to-invite-iranian-foreign-minister-for-talks-over-protests/">EU to invite Iranian foreign minister for talks over protests</a></p><p></p><p>The European Union will invite Iran’s foreign minister for talks about the recent anti-government protests that have hit the country, Germany’s Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel said on Sunday (7 January).</p><p></p><p>EU should listen to America</p><p></p><p>But not all agree with this approach. The Wilfried Martens Centre for European Studies, the official think tank of the centre-right European People’s Party (EPP), takes a different view on the issue, saying that the EU should understand the “rightful concerns” voiced by the US Congress.</p><p></p><p>Roland Freudenstein, a policy director at the centre, said there are some deep flaws in the current nuclear deal, which have been identified by Washington.</p><p></p><p>“Verification of Iranian compliance is not assured, and Iran’s race to a nuclear capability has been merely slowed down a bit. Besides, the deal does not cover Iranian development of missile systems and other weaponry, not to mention Iran’s worldwide export of terrorism,” Freudenstein noted.</p><p></p><p>For these reasons, says Freudenstein, the EU should work with the Americans on a unified position on how to correct these flaws or impose new sanctions on Iran.</p><p></p><p>“And no one in Brussels should encourage European companies to do business with a regime that sends spies to Europe to prepare to kill Jews (as was the case in Germany) and is responsible for massive war crimes in Syria.”</p><p></p><p>Freudenstein went further, stating that the US is a NATO ally guaranteeing Europe’s security against very real conventional and nuclear threats.</p><p></p><p>“And for decades to come, Europe will not be able to deter enemies and defend its territory in the same manner. So we should ask ourselves why Americans should continue to defend us if we openly oppose them in crucial questions of international security – especially our own security, in the case of Iran,” he added.</p><p></p><p>“I don’t think we’re hostages, we just need to be a little less lecturing vis-à-vis the Americans and instead try to work out a common position.

EurActiv.com All Rights Reserved. </p><p></p><p>Despite the well-known differences on trade, climate change and Iran, a closer examination of the EU-US strategy reveals a number of shared priorities for 2018, writes Fraser Cameron.</p><p></p><p>Fraser Cameron is Director of the EU-Asia Centre and a Senior Advisor at Cambre Associates.</p><p></p><p>Much of the European commentary following publication of President Trump’s national security strategy (NSS) in December was highly critical. But despite the well-known differences on trade, climate change and Iran a closer examination of the strategy reveals a number of shared priorities.</p><p></p><p>Trump announced that the US was engaged in a new era of competition facing rivals such as Russia and China ‘that seek to challenge American influence, values, and wealth.’ This is similar to EU assessments that point to Moscow and Beijing’s aggressive foreign policy and attempts to undermine democracy. Trump went on to state that he hoped ‘to build a great partnership with those and other countries’ which again is what the EU is trying to do. The EU still describes its relations with Russia and China as strategic partnerships although this description realistically can no longer be applied to Russia as there is almost a complete rupture in relations following its annexation of Crimea and support for separatist forces in eastern Ukraine. And despite Trump’s reluctance to criticise Putin his administration has now agreed to provide defensive weapons to Ukraine, a move that Obama refused to make.</p><p></p><p>Another highlight of the NSS was trade policy based on ‘the principles of fairness and reciprocity.’ If you listen to the litany of EU complaints against China, calling for ‘a level playing field’ you can see the similarities with Trump’s approach. Both the EU and US are negotiating bilateral investment treaties with China and facing similar problems on market access. Brussels and Washington are also tightening their trade defence instruments vis-à-vis China.</p><p></p><p>Trump also called for greater attention to homeland security and confirmed his intention to build a wall on the border with Mexico. The EU may not go in for building walls but some of its member states have erected pretty daunting fences to deter migrants. The EU has also struck a Faustian deal with Turkey and Libya to reduce the flow of refugees to the EU.</p><p></p><p>Another priority for Trump was modernisation of the military. Again this has been a top theme for Federica Mogherini with the December European Council endorsing her proposals for closer defence cooperation (PESCO). She has boasted that ‘more has been achieved in the past ten months than the past decade’. She will soon discover, however, that securing agreement on paper is one thing, securing agreement to rationalise defence procurement let alone place troops in harm’s way is quite another.</p><p></p><p>Although he emphasised the need for a strong economy, Trump also recognised the need to strengthen alliances to cope with new threats. Yes, these allies should pay more for their own security but there was no talk of the US going it alone in today’s world. Trump’s call for Europeans to pay more is also not new. It was a running theme of the Obama administration with his defence secretary, Bob Gates, starkly warning Europe that Americans were fed up with paying the lion’s share to defend Europe. The fact that his warnings were largely ignored by most EU governments has led Trump to up the rhetoric but it is not a change in American policy. Chancellor Merkel seemed to get it when she said last October that Europeans will have to look after their own security. But Berlin has been a laggard in moving towards the 2% NATO target for defence spending.</p><p></p><p>Trump is often and rightly criticised for not mentioning human rights as a foreign policy commitment. But he did say that while the US did not seek to impose its way of life on anyone it would champion American values without apology. He tends to use ‘freedom’ rather than human rights or democracy in his speeches but this is also a shared value with Europe.</p><p></p><p>The actual NSS document thus offers a certain continuity in US foreign policy although for domestic reasons Trump sought to distance himself from the ‘misguided views’ of his predecessors. They had been responsible for negotiating ‘disastrous trade deals’ at the expense of American jobs. They had failed to build up the nation at home, failed to fund the military, and failed to insist that America’s allies pay their fair share for defence. They had neglected the North Korean nuclear menace, made a ‘disastrous, weak, and incomprehensibly bad deal with Iran’ and had surrendered US sovereignty to ‘foreign bureaucrats in faraway and distant capitals.’</p><p></p><p>But all this was changing said Trump. He defended his decision to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the ‘very expensive and unfair’ Paris Climate Accord. He said that he had scolded the NATO allies who were not paying their fair dues. He promised that North Korea ‘will be taken care of’ without offering any details.</p><p></p><p>A sensible EU approach would be to seize the opportunities in the NSS to enhance cooperation with the US especially in dealing with Russia and China. The EU should also continue to reach out to different constituencies in the US to support EU objectives – Congress on the Iran deal, the individual states such as California on the Paris climate agreement. And above all the EU needs to have a serious discussion, post Brexit, about how to take more responsibility for its own security. Trump may have done the EU a favour by kick-starting this debate.</p><p></p><p>文件 EURACOM020180108ee1800007</p><p></p><p><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhMAAoAPcAAAAAAP////j0AP//APn1AB4loSEoniIpnSMqnCUsmyYtmicumictmSwyljA2lDo/jC41lS82kzI5kjM5kTQ6kDU7jzc9jjk/jDpAjDpAizxBijxCij9EiEBGh0BFh0JHhkNIhUVKhEVKg0ZLg01RfUhNgUlOgEpPgEtQgExRf09UfVBUfFNXelNXeVRYeVlcdVFWe1VZeFVZd1dbd1xfc1hcdlpedFledVtfc11hcltgc19jcWFkb2Jlb15jcmBkcGNmbmVobWZpbGZqa2ptaW1xZmxvZ3BzZHN2YnR3YXR3Ynh7XnZ5YHp9XX1/W4yOUIqMUYqMUomLUoeJU4OFVYSGVoGDV36AWX6AWq6vNqusOaqrOqmqOqOkPqKjQKGiQJ+gQZ+gQp6fQp2eQ52eRJmaRpiZR5eYR5iZSJaYSZSVSZOUTJGSTJCRTY2PT4qLUYiJUnx9W//8AP/+AP36APv4APn2Aff0Afn2Avj1Avf0AvbzAvXyA/TxBPPwBfHuBfHuBvDtBu/sBvTxB/LvB+7rB/T0CPTxCPHuCO7rCO3qCO/tCezpCe3qCuvoCurnC+zpDOrnDOfkDOnmDebjDefkD+TiD+ThEOPgEOLfEeHeEePhEuHeEt/dE97cE97bFN7cFdzZFdzaFdvYFdzaFtzZFtvYFtnXF9nYGNnXGNzbGdfVGdfVGtXTGdnXG9XTGtPSG9TSHNLQHNHPHdHQHtDOHs/OHs/NH8/NIMzLIM3MIcvKIcvJIczLIsvKIsrIIsnIIsnHI8jGJMfFJcXEJsTDJsPBJ8LBKMHAKMC/KcC/Kr++KsHAK7+/LLy7Lbu6Lb29Lrq5Lrq6L7m4L7i3L7m5MLi3MLe2Mba1MbW0MrOyM7GxNLCwNa6tN62tN6yrOKysOKurOaioO6enPKamPaWlPaSkPqOjP6GhQaCgQp2dRJqaRpKSS//6AP75AP35APz3APr1APr2APjzAPj0APfzAfbxAvXxA/TwA/LuBfHtBejkDOXhD9bTGtLPHP///yH5BAEAAP8ALAAAAAAwACgAAAj/AAUIHEiwoMGDCBMqXMiwoUOF8uC1kzNngMU5ct7VIfCwI4F3GO3ts/UMnDkv5LYdOyWozgA68TpCzJgJXBMWHDRk2ODBw4YHDy6ACHJmVp45dWQWlDenDzYiHU4cMUNtViZGhQoporQqWRcnLjjgEEdIDkelcvBkcUFCCq8/dAbIaVenbl147uTIrRcKHQ8c2TR6HNCvBwtwgOTKO7tQ3rsB8oAtgdLonUN5crKMUONnQFKlAgjIoXNszKPPCkWTKSHMM+iCoie9ajhHiwhWcuXISyiv3W7YlgnMkTevDp56C+X049BsgCVkwQr9hh0IFiDGAvnySTSOH+rU74gg/xngRUSOGMsGcJRTh44cvVsWZJkjgOmAOapSGKpEg5b6eXTQkVA7sljQCy4XICNHPo44o48AyHQSTC7Y5GHEBkfU8c4i3oCxyhkZiJGKM7E8w8c7ugTzHUEDrGMBH3DAcIss72TyQSb1yJBFDyW08YoK1YRQyh5A7FDFMldccEUyKlwDgi90tBAGfQaJ1gQHe8RhQQpJyJPJCJjcYcM2NbQxwBpKDLBDOs6YsIhcroxwCCIioHJEFLGEcMmKAhFQRxIUJDJFC37IM8AmI1SCBwvb/DCNHDPIAEcKQaDhg3tyyDICIYmI8Ik0MTTBhFkHiVbFASRK8MQqwxTjQTHeOP+gjQ7O2ALCN9uU88EbHDhzCiOrZMALJh20wgcKERwjR0IDgHMAEHRY88IKNxzjxgmiJnPFLuRMYZEcTYSRBgk24CJAESlkc8QoA5ghRKEJ1VHJCAqoM4AeiuQjjx2K5KHHHvbU44ceHBGgRx/vCCJIPfLsocg9AXO0B3YHzUGOAhCQo1hoGxHg8ccDLebnZ/JstFho0/EmzxIIQMCOHqS+Fo9d77yTMkLvEIJEAgz0kMt7NzckTz6iiGKJKatIErRB7+jBxgQGTLAEL3koRnGVHrszThpUWIEFE14sy1AdcvwyBAQFRLDDGLLk85hc7bhT80Tv6cFIPpmM8w0YWTD/A80wfCYkhx3GLNGBAgVAwKUa3SBTyyqirJKLM1mUs00uighgRx551CHP5zJhRgcl10ARhAgSNBBBBRhwEAILREgRjiyFbBSax32+5idGAgSCCSy/CBPMLJoossd771z90MmhHRTPO6O9Nxcdnvc5HcgN1VNIH3fUw0ceAtBVV/L6JEJcIXa4kw8+GtWxRyAavnMPAffYUXPNCNWRSRbDfHLKNNkIxi48AQpSyEIO2vACHxhRBmTAYhq/eIUpIjELdfCiH6eoBTeSsYpXzKKDEzNIHUIhjmcQQxbKYMMUyMEFJ4yDHPXABhSWwYgudIML4ihHNLaBjVtwwRtc+EI2dbihhXB4QR3Z+IIighaPQuiiE8PQxyQ+MYtXcCIWn7AFHzxxDFPgAxKbGKAoZqGNVChiEKx4hT9CcYpXwMIWmcDELgKhPAJQjw4EKFnNNKQhAZCtY+25iyXq85E9xk8j8sDja8a2yEY68pGQjKQkJ0nJShIkIAA7" /></p><p></p><p><a id="toc28"></a><strong>Anti-coal drive at UN climate talks stalked by pro-coal White House</strong></p><p></p><p>admin </p><p>1,009 字</p><p>2017 年 11 月 17 日 16:20</p><p>EurActiv.com</p><p>EURACOM</p><p>英文</p><p>Copyright 2017.

This is far above the goal enshrined in the 2015 Paris climate agreement, which limits warming to well below 2 degrees.</p><p></p><p><a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/climate-environment/news/emission-cuts-were-two-thirds-below-whats-needed-un-says/">Emission cuts: We're two-thirds below what's needed, UN says</a></p><p></p><p>The UN published its annual emission gap report on Tuesday (31 October), highlighting a dismal record:  ahead of COP23, countries fall two-thirds short of what is needed to reach the agreed reduction in emissions.</p><p></p><p>Scientists say that any rise above 2 degrees takes the planet into dangerous weather patterns with increased droughts, floods and more frequent and powerful storms.</p><p></p><p>Small island states, many of which are already suffering the effects of rising sea levels and powerful storms, want the warming limited to 1.5 degrees.</p><p></p><p>“Agriculture is a large source of powerful greenhouse gases … but has great potential to store carbon and reduce greenhouse gases in our lifetime,” said Helena Molin Valdes, head of the Climate and Clean Air Coalition Secretariat.</p><p></p><p>Agriculture, forestry and changes in land use together produce 21% of global greenhouse gas emissions, making them the second largest emitter after the energy sector, according to FAO.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the global demand for food is expected to soar as the population is projected to grow to 9.7 billion people by 2050, up from 7.6 billion today. “We need to feed them, and at the same time, we need to curb emissions from agriculture … We think it’s doable,” Castro, FAO’s assistant director general, said on the sidelines of the UN talks.</p><p></p><p><a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/climate-environment/news/civic-groups-want-international-carbon-tax-on-overseas-polluters/">Civic groups want international carbon tax on overseas polluters</a></p><p></p><p>EXCLUSIVE: EU companies investing in oil and gas extraction overseas can reap hefty profits but also threaten global carbon targets. In reaction, a number of civic groups have jointly proposed a carbon tax on products and income derived from overseas extraction.</p><p></p><p>Livestock account for nearly two-thirds of agriculture emissions, says FAO. But changes in the way livestock are raised have been successfully piloted and could be scaled up.</p><p></p><p>Recent projects in Brazil and Argentina, for example, have managed to increase livestock productivity from one cow per hectare to four cows per hectare, and at the same time absorb carbon dioxide and methane emissions by better managing grasslands and soils and planting trees, Castro said.</p><p></p><p>Costa Rica already grows carbon dioxide-neutral coffee and China says it plans to do the same with tea, he said.</p><p></p><p>“So if a small country like Costa Rica can do it, and a big player like China can also do it, in the middle you have every other country,” said Castro, who is Cost Rica’s former minister for the environment.</p><p></p><p>Christian Schmidt, Germany’s federal minister of food and agriculture, said: “(Agriculture‘s) potential to offer climate change solutions is enormous.”</p><p></p><p><a href="https://bitly.com/pages/landing/branded-short-domains-powered-by-bitly?bsd=on.cgiar.org">Research conducted by the CGIAR</a> Research Programme on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS) has already identified ten existing agricultural innovations with the potential to transform agriculture around the world in all of these ways.</p><p></p><p>These include micro-irrigation systems powered by solar, stress-tolerant crop varieties, weather index-based agricultural insurance schemes and climate-informed advisories for rural populations.</p><p></p><p><a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/climate-environment/news/bloomberg-pledges-50m-to-help-countries-bin-coal/">Bloomberg pledges $50m to help Europe bin coal</a></p><p></p><p>US billionaire media mogul Michael Bloomberg has promised $50m to the international effort to scrap coal power, following a similar domestic campaign that has seen 50% of American coal plants close since 2011.</p><p></p><p>文件 EURACOM020171113edbd0002u</p><p></p><p><img src="data:image/gif;base64,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" /></p><p></p><p><a id="toc30"></a><strong>EU and California to discuss linking carbon markets</strong></p><p></p><p>Catherine Stupp </p><p>894 字</p><p>2017 年 11 月 8 日 13:45</p><p>EurActiv.com</p><p>EURACOM</p><p>英文</p><p>Copyright 2017.

California, the most populous US state, already has a common carbon market that shares permits for greenhouse gas emissions with the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec.</p><p></p><p>A common carbon market with the EU “would be a concrete kind of investment move that California and other states and provinces could become a part of,” Brown said.</p><p></p><p>Brown also met with Commission Vice-President Maroš Šefčovič and discussed plans to link carbon markets with Commission officials who work on emissions trading.</p><p></p><p>The EU, which has the world’s largest carbon market, previously agreed to link its system with Australia, but that deal was later scrapped. China is likely to set up its own emissions trading system and would then eclipse the EU as the world’s largest market.</p><p></p><p><a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/climate-environment/news/why-the-cop23-climate-change-summit-in-bonn-matters/">Why the COP23 climate change summit in Bonn matters</a></p><p></p><p>As the UN’s climate conference kicks off in Bonn on Monday (6 November), EURACTIV’s partner The Guardian looks at what issues will be discussed in Germany and what we can expect from the high-level conference.</p><p></p><p>The California governor is on a ten-day tour of Europe that includes talks at the UN COP23 conference in Bonn, where he will speak at the Chinese pavilion on emissions trading.</p><p></p><p>Brown has vowed to uphold the commitments in the Paris climate agreement to slash emissions on behalf of California, although US President Donald Trump announced in June that he will withdraw the federal government from the deal.</p><p></p><p>For now, the US federal government remains a signatory to the Paris agreement and will participate in discussions with other countries on how to implement it, the US’ senior envoy said at the start of the COP23 on Monday.</p><p></p><p>As a result of the California governor’s outspoken international push to fight climate change, EU politicians appeared eager to embrace Brown as an opponent to Trump’s policies.</p><p></p><p>European Parliament President Antonio Tajani said at the opening of a conference on clean energy on Tuesday, “The approach of Mr Trump at a global level is not necessarily as helpful as it might be but we are delighted to have Governor Brown here because it shows there is a strong commitment from the US.”</p><p></p><p>Brown will host a climate summit in San Francisco in September 2018, which Cañete plans to attend. The California governor wants that participants at that conference to outline specific plans to reduce emissions.</p><p></p><p>“You can think of the Paris agreement for nation states, the San Francisco conference will be a San Francisco agreement for subnational states and organisations,” Brown said.</p><p></p><p>He emphasised that regions and countries need to double down on their commitments and invest more money into fighting climate change.</p><p></p><p>“I always thought the European Union was a cumbersome organisation, but if you take the rest of the world it’s virtually ungovernable. It’s a big task and I don’t want to minimise or sound utopian,” Brown said.</p><p></p><p>“This is an absolute necessity to constantly lower our carbon emissions and get to that goal well before 2050, and then we have to go to negative and extract carbon from the environment. We don’t even know how to do that in the economical way. But if we don’t, the price will be harm, catastrophe. Europe won’t look pretty, nor will many other parts of the world,” he added.</p><p></p><p>Cooperation on zero-emission vehicles</p><p></p><p>In addition to committing to further discussions about connecting California and the EU’s carbon markets, Brown and Cañete also agreed to work together on developing zero-carbon transport.

Just how hard the EU should hit on wrongdoers remains a major sticking point, however.</p><p></p><p>As Europe embarks on a new round of trade talks with Japan, Australia, New Zealand and Mercosur, calls are growing for the EU to enforce environmental and social clauses in commercial agreements.</p><p></p><p>“Let me say once and for all: we are not naïve free traders,” said Jean-Claude Juncker in his annual State of the Union <a href="http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_SPEECH-17-3165_en.htm">speech</a> in the European Parliament last September.</p><p></p><p>“Trade is about exporting our standards, be they social or environmental standards, data protection or food safety requirements,” Juncker said, announcing a “new industrial policy strategy” that places innovation, digitisation and the decarbonisation of the economy at the centre of the EU’s trade agenda.</p><p></p><p><a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/ceta/news/junckers-trade-push-starts-with-australia-new-zealand/">Juncker’s trade push starts with Australia, New Zealand</a></p><p></p><p>As anticipated in recent weeks, trade topped the Juncker Commission’s priorities for the rest of its mandate.</p><p></p><p>The debate has moved forward since then, based on a <a href="http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/press/index.cfm?id=1689">European Commission discussion paper</a> published in July, which addresses the enforcement of the Sustainable Development chapters in the EU’s trade agreements.</p><p></p><p>The first so-called Trade and Sustainable Development chapter (TSD) was adopted as part of the EU-South Korea Free Trade Agreement in 2011.</p><p></p><p>The watchword here is enforcement. But how far should Europe go when it comes to slapping sanctions on countries found breaching the rules?</p><p></p><p>This is where the consensus ends.</p><p></p><p>For environmental NGOs, “non-compliance with sustainability and environment conditions must have consequences if they are to be taken seriously”. This means introducing a dispute settlement mechanism similar to the infamous tribunals that were once envisaged to protect the interests of private investors in the EU-Canada trade deal, CETA.</p><p></p><p>“Any violations of environmental protections in EU trade agreements should be subject to the same state-to-state dispute settlement as violations of the commercial clauses,” says a <a href="https://www.transportenvironment.org/publications/trade-and-sustainable-development-%E2%80%93-chance-innovative-thinking">new study</a> by sustainable transport group Transport &amp; Environment (T&amp;E), published on Tuesday (24 October).</p><p></p><p>“The new generation of EU trade agreements still exclude the use of state-to-state dispute settlement for the sustainable development chapters,” T&amp;E said, calling on future deals to “make the liberalisation of trade conditional on all sustainability provisions being enforced and adhered to”.</p><p></p><p>In practice, this would mean adding environmental criteria such as greenhouse gas emissions, land use, water and air quality in the EU’s investigations for the imposition of anti-dumping duties, T&amp;E said.</p><p></p><p>“There should also be a scorecard for the EU’s developing trade partners to ensure that they engage with and implement international environmental agreements such as the Paris climate agreement,” said Cécile Toubeau, trade director at T&amp;E who co-authored the study.</p><p></p><p>Parts of industry will applaud such calls, like European steelmakers, who have repeatedly complained about dumped imports from China.</p><p></p><p><a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/economy-jobs/news/eu-imposes-import-duties-on-some-chinese-steel-to-counter-subsidies/">EU imposes import duties on some Chinese steel to counter subsidies</a></p><p></p><p>The European Union has imposed provisional import duties of as much as 28.5% on certain Chinese corrosion-resistant steels after an eight-month investigation found that the products benefited from unfair subsidies.</p><p></p><p>On the other end of the spectrum is BusinessEurope, the EU’s employer’s lobby, which also sees environmental and sustainability issues as a key priority in trade deals. But for the opposite reasons.</p><p></p><p>“Looking at ways to increase the effectiveness and implementation of trade and sustainable development chapters in free trade agreements is fine, as long as it does not hinder the EU’s negotiating leverage and engagement of trading partners,” <a href="https://www.businesseurope.eu/sites/buseur/files/media/speeches/2017-10-18_tss_speech_emma_final.pdf">said Emma Marcegaglia</a>, President of BusinessEurope, during the tripartite social summit in Brussels last Wednesday (18 October).</p><p></p><p>“The EU should, therefore, put in place a system built on positive incentives rather than on negative sanctions,” Marcegaglia said, referring to newly-negotiated trade agreements, which now contain chapters on Trade and Sustainable Development (TSD).</p><p></p><p>Shifting sands</p><p></p><p>While Germany, backed by the UK, has traditionally favoured an unbridled free-trade agenda, positions might be changing in light of the widespread public rejection of the EU’s free trade deal with Canada, and increasingly protectionist US policies.</p><p></p><p>In May, the trade ministers of Belgium, Finland, Luxembourg, Finland and the Netherlands  – traditionally seen as free-trade champions – sent a <a href="http://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/20170511155157994.pdf?utm_source=POLITICO.EU&amp;utm_campaign=e95ace0190-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2017_06_27&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_10959edeb5-e95ace0190-189774485">letter</a> to EU commissioner Cecilia Malmström calling for “improving the implementation of TSD provisions” in EU trade policy.</p><p></p><p>France, for the time being, seems to be sitting somewhere in the middle, probably out of courtesy for German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is in the midst of tricky government negotiations with the Liberals and Greens – two parties with radically opposite views on trade policy.</p><p></p><p>However, the long-held position in Paris is to support greater “reciprocity” in trade talks, including on environmental and labour standards.</p><p></p><p><a href="https://ue.delegfrance.org/faire-avancer-l-europe-qui-protege#Declaration-du-President-de-la-Republique-a-l-issue-au-Conseil-europeen-nbsp">Speaking at the conclusion of last week’s EU summit on Friday (20 October)</a>, French President Emmanuel Macron called for “a reform of European trade policy”, based on  the principles of “fairness and reciprocity,” a long-standing demand from Paris, which for many years has complained about the strength of the euro favouring Germany and penalising French exports.</p><p></p><p><a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/economic-governance/interview/german-trade-surplus-responsible-for-eurozone-inequity/">French economist: 'German trade surplus responsible for eurozone inequity'</a></p><p></p><p>The economic imbalances of the eurozone are undermining citizens’ confidence in the European project. Cutting Germany’s trade surplus could help redress the balance, Jérôme Creel said in an interview with <a href="http://www.euractiv.fr/section/all/interview/pour-contrer-leuroscepticisme-il-faut-que-lallemagne-reduise-son-excedent-commercial/">EURACTIV France</a>.</p><p></p><p>Macron is no different in this regard but he places the discussion in a different context than his predecessors, saying Europe is now confronted with a twin challenge on trade.</p><p></p><p>The “internal challenge”, he said, is to rebuild public trust in trade policy, which has been seriously eroded after the EU-Canada treaty debacle, while the “external challenge” is to pursue a “growth agenda” for Europe, “at a time when the United States is at an isolationist turning point”.</p><p></p><p>In this context, Macron insisted on increasing transparency in trade negotiations and on strengthening the enforcement aspects of trade deals.</p><p></p><p>“I will be very vigilant that in each of these agreements, the principle of reciprocity is upheld, so that our stronger and more stringent environmental standards are respected…and that our social criteria are also taken into account,” Macron said.</p><p></p><p><a href="http://www.euractiv.com/section/economy-jobs/news/not-so-fast-macron-and-his-farmers-get-trade-onto-full-eu-summit-agenda/">Not so fast: Macron and his farmers get trade onto ‘full’ EU summit agenda</a></p><p></p><p>French President Emmanuel Macron has succeeded in pushing trade onto the agenda of the EU summit which starts on Thursday (19 October), calling for caution in commercial deals that would bring a surge of beef and other agricultural imports.</p><p></p><p>Malmström hesitant</p><p></p><p>EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmström, for her part, seems undecided at this stage. In a <a href="http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2017/october/tradoc_156137.pdf">speech</a> on 6 October, she said two scenarios were possible:</p><p></p><p>* A “more assertive partnership” based on the current enforcement mechanisms (which T&amp;E branded as the status quo); or</p><p></p><p>* Moving towards “a sanctions-based enforcement model” that still needs to be defined.</p><p></p><p>According to T&amp;E, Malmström appeared to lean in favour of the lowest common denominator when she sought to dispel some “misunderstandings” on the sustainable development chapters of existing free trade agreements.</p><p></p><p>“Contrary to some opinions, the EU’s TSD chapters are both binding and subject to a dispute settlement mechanism,” the Swedish commissioner said in her October speech. By incorporating the conventions – such as those of the International Labour Organisation and Multilateral Environmental Agreements – the EU is “not only linked to the standards contained in these conventions, but also to their monitoring and enforcement mechanisms,” she stressed.</p><p></p><p>Multilateral bodies such as ILO and the UN indeed have established mechanisms to report on and follow the implementation of international conventions, Malmström underlined, adding that Europeans should take those into account “before re-inventing the wheel”.</p><p></p><p>“From a more pragmatic point of view, I think that the most fundamental issue is: what is actually working and what isn’t, and what tools do we need to address that?,” the Commissioner said.</p><p></p><p>Commission sources did not elaborate when asked by EURACTIV about the timetable for implementing changes to the TSD mecamism, although Brussels made no secret of its intention to conclude a trade deal with Mercosur by the end of the year.</p><p></p><p><a href="http://www.euractiv.com/section/economy-jobs/news/commission-pushes-for-concluding-mercosur-deal-by-end-of-year/">Commission pushes for concluding Mercosur deal by end of year</a></p><p></p><p>Despite France’s concerns about an EU-Mercosur deal, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker insisted on Friday (20 October) on reaching an agreement by the end of this year because it is “the most important” trade deal for Europe.</p><p></p><p>More generally, the EU executive pointed to “the values of Europeans” that are already reflected in trade policy, including the respect for human rights, basic standards for the treatment of workers or care for the environment.</p><p></p><p>“Conditions included in our one-way preferential schemes for developing countries such as GSP help prevent violations of international standards,” it said, citing cases where the benefits of the scheme were withdrawn, as happened in the past for instance with Sri Lanka, Myanmar and Belarus.</p><p></p><p>“Environmental conditionality is part of our GSP+ scheme,” the Commission source explained, saying those are part of the EU’s “modern trade agreements that include legal guarantees” on the environment.</p><p></p><p>“Their Trade and Sustainable Development Chapters have a dedicated mechanism that follows a normal model of government consultations, a panel of independent experts, and publication of binding  report with recommendations. The system enables also interaction at all stages with experts e.g. in ILO and with the dedicated civil society groups.</p><p></p><p>“The provisions under the TSD chapter of the EU Trade agreements are fully enforceable,” the Commission source said.</p><p></p><p>While debate continues on changes to the TSD, French President Macron raised the pressure on the Commission to sanction dumping and unfair trade practices more “swiftly and emphatically” than in the past.</p><p></p><p>“We will have the opportunity in the coming weeks to have a broad discussion” on trade policy, Macron said.</p><p></p><p><a

13:54</p><p>EurActiv.com</p><p>EURACOM</p><p>英文</p><p>Copyright 2017. EurActiv.com All Rights Reserved. </p><p></p><p>For more than a decade, the EU and India partnership had been slow-moving and fragmented, struggling to maintain momentum. The last EU-India summit however shows EU-India relations have come full circle, writes Gauri Khandekar.</p><p></p><p>Gauri Khandekar is Researcher at the Institute for European Studies at the Brussels Free University. In 2011 she called the EU-India relationship “A Loveless Arranged Marriage”.</p><p></p><p>The 2017 EU-India Summit stands as a watershed moment in the relationship’s timeline having transformed EU-India ties into a veritable strategic partnership by securing it firmly onto two new forward-looking pillars – a platform for climate and energy cooperation and a partnership on sustainable urbanization. The summit also registered a pledge by the European Investment Bank to invest a further €800m in solar projects across India and the conclusion of a mobility agreement for young scientists and researchers.</p><p></p><p>For more than a decade, the EU and India partnership had been slow-moving and fragmented, struggling to maintain momentum. The relationship remained far too focused on set-piece summits rather than fostering dynamic everyday linkages. Meetings, including summits, would be ritually cancelled and the paucity of high-level bilateral visits revealed a lack of political will. Unfairly large emphasis was laid on foreign policy cooperation, but on many issues divisions far exceeded commonalities, leading to disappointment and an overall delusion in the potential of the partnership.</p><p></p><p>India’s transition from an aid-recipient to a donor country in the early 2010s meant an end to EU development aid to India – for long the mainstay of the relationship. Moreover, a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) – the partnership’s most imaginative moment – would for numerous reasons prove difficult to materialise. A number of the then-quasi strategic partnership’s other initiatives too (maritime cooperation, a Civil Nuclear Energy Fission Agreement, a Europol Agreement and others) remained in the pipelines for far too long. Overall, the EU failed to conjecture a partnership with rising India beyond trade or aid.</p><p></p><p>The establishment of the two platforms for climate and energy and sustainable urban cooperation strikes the right note to define and transform future EU-India relations given India stands on the cusp of major transformations in both the energy and urban fields driven by strong social and economic rationales. These initiatives are therefore timely, not only for India and the EU, but also for global climate efforts.</p><p></p><p>For one, the scale of India’s energy and urban transformation will be monumental. As the world’s fourth largest emitter of greenhouse gases (GHGs), an environmentally sustainable transition in India will have a significant impact on global climate efforts.</p><p></p><p>Second, India’s urban and energy transformation represents an immense economic opportunity. India’s Twelfth Five Year Plan (2012-2017) estimated infrastructure investment at around $1.25 trillion, with 40%  emanating from the private sector. Similarly, the investment opportunities in India’s dynamically growing renewable energy sector are vast. The Indian government is keen on achieving 175GW renewable energy capacity by 2022. Indeed, India was named the second most attractive renewables market for 2017 by consulting firm EY.</p><p></p><p>With these two platforms, EU companies now have a level playing field against actors like China, Japan, Canada, Australia and the US who have aggressively competed for presence in India’s lucrative infrastructure and energy markets. Not only would tapping into these markets enhance economic growth and job creation back in the EU, but would also enhance the EU’s image as a strategic actor in India.</p><p></p><p>Third, these initiatives can potentially launch the EU and India as global climate leaders. Following US President Donald Trump’s announcement in June 2017 to quit the Paris Climate Agreement, many feared the US decision may derail international climate efforts in particular by encouraging other countries to follow suit. While the latter has not yet ensued, there is a need for climate champions beyond the EU. During his visit to Europe in June 2017, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi vowed to go “above and beyond” the Paris Climate Agreement. Modi’s India seems committed to climate action judging by recent efforts like the launch of the International Solar Alliance, proposals to increase the country’s non-fossil fuel electricity share from 31% to 53% cent as early as 2027 (according to India’s Central Electricity Authority), plans to becoming an all-EV nation by 2030, amongst others.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, the EU and India have reinforced their commitment to the Paris Climate Agreement. Under a bilateral Agenda for Action 2020 released at the 2016 EU-India bilateral summit held in Brussels, both partners pledged to enforcing their Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) and enhance cooperation in areas such as energy efficiency of buildings, development of renewable energy including smart grids and fostering research and innovation</p><p></p><p>While these two initiatives will undoubtedly strengthen the EU-India relationship, there is scope for much more. The EU and India must now supplement the energy and urban cooperation pillars with a symbiotic third pillar on innovation cooperation. Socially and environmentally friendly innovation will be essential for any successful, sustainable energy and urban transformative change-making. While the EU and India both have strong individual innovation communities, building a dedicated platform that fosters innovation partnerships can help strengthen nascent cooperation on energy and urbanisation. Out-of-the-box thinking may also help circumvent jammed FTA negotiations and release mutually beneficial opportunities. While the FTA may not materialise in the next five years both partners can instead seek to liberalise trade sector-by-sector.</p><p></p><p>Nonetheless, as of 2017, the EU and India appear to have reinstated the strategic quotient in their bilateral partnership. As a long-term investment, the EU-India Platform on Climate and Energy Cooperation and the bilateral Partnership on Sustainable Urbanisation will effectively cement the perception of the EU as a strategic partner in New Delhi, confirm the EU’s commitment to promoting sustainable development in India, and foster the inchoate role of partners as international climate leaders.</p><p></p><p>文件 EURACOM020171018edai00001</p><p></p><p><img src="data:image/gif;base64,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" /></p><p></p><p><a id="toc33"></a><strong>Carbon tax could wipe out polluters’ profits in pursuit of Paris targets</strong></p><p></p><p>Richard Partington </p><p>960 字</p><p>2017 年 9 月 4 日 17:08</p><p>EurActiv.com</p><p>EURACOM</p><p>英文</p><p>Copyright 2017.

Such companies, including those in the construction, steel and commodity chemicals sectors, could see profits fall by 80%.</p><p></p><p><a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/energy/news/paris-withdraws-plans-for-carbon-tax-on-coal/">Paris withdraws plans for carbon tax on coal</a></p><p></p><p>Pressure from the miners’ and energy workers’ union CGT forced the French government to back down on extending the carbon tax to coal-fired power stations. <a href="http://www.journaldelenvironnement.net/article/le-gouvernement-renonce-a-la-taxe-carbone-pour-le-charbon,75942">EURACTIV’s partner Journal de l’Environnement reports</a>.</p><p></p><p>Andy Howard, the head of sustainable research at Schroders, said investors should focus on picking companies that could survive in a low-carbon economy. “The debate about whether climate change is something we should be worrying about has passed. You need to do something and here’s what it is, and it helps to pick relative beneficiaries,” he said.</p><p></p><p>Higher taxes to discourage heavy use of fossil fuels have come in the form of carbon pricing. Many schemes, such as those in the UK and Europe, involve quota systems, whereby companies are given pollution permits that can be traded on an exchange.</p><p></p><p>The European Union’s emissions trading system (ETS) is the world’s biggest scheme for trading greenhouse gas emissions allowances. It covers 11,000 power stations and industrial plants in 30 countries, whose carbon emissions make up almost 50% of Europe’s total.</p><p></p><p>But the ETS has come under fire for being overly lenient on heavy users, while the EU has been accused of giving away too many permits – leading to low prices. The value of carbon credits in the EU is about €5.80 a tonne, which could make it cheaper for companies to pollute than change their behaviour.</p><p></p><p><a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/energy-environment/news/the-eu-and-switzerland-link-their-carbon-markets/">The EU and Switzerland link their carbon markets</a></p><p></p><p>The world’s first carbon trading system has found a new partner in Switzerland. EURACTIV France reports.</p><p></p><p>Schroders estimates the current global price to be roughly $1.60 a tonne of CO2e. At that price, this values the amount of CO2e produced by a barrel of oil at less than $0.70, or under 2% of the average Brent crude price over the past year.</p><p></p><p>Howard said that, at $100 a tonne, the value of carbon in barrel of oil would be closer to $40, which was getting closer to a level that was commensurate with the value of oil itself.</p><p></p><p>The fund manager estimates the move to $100 carbon pricing across various global schemes will probably happen over the next three decades. But the hit to earnings might not come if companies cut their reliance on fossil fuels, while the decline in global profit could be offset by new eco-friendly companies filling in the gaps.</p><p></p><p>The change is not going to be easy, as new companies emerge and traditional ones change or disappear. “Cutting emissions is hard enough and far enough, to get to 2% is going to be disruptive, there’s really no way around that,” said Howard. “There will though be opportunities in other parts of the market, for new companies that may or not even yet exist.”</p><p></p><p>More countries are adopting carbon pricing, including China. President Xi Jinping has announced that the country is to launch the world’s largest market for emissions permits this year. When the Chinese scheme goes ahead, almost a quarter of the world’s emissions will have a price attached.</p><p></p><p><a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/economy-jobs/news/eu-china-stumble-into-uncharted-closer-trade-relationship/">EU, China stumble into uncharted closer trade relationship</a></p><p></p><p>Just hours after President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of the Paris climate agreement, the EU and China tried on Friday (2 June) to find common ground to ease trade tensions that have divided them in recent months.</p><p></p><p>Donald Trump has rejected calls to introduce a carbon tax in the US, saying it would cost jobs. Philip Hammond, the British finance minister, is expected to give more details about carbon pricing in the UK for the 2020s in his autumn budget.</p><p></p><p>A group of leading economists warned this year of catastrophic global warming within 13 years unless countries ramped up taxes on carbon emissions to as much as $100 per tonne.</p><p></p><p>The economist and Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz and the former World Bank chief economist Nicholas Stern were among experts who said governments needed to tackle polluting industries with a tax on carbon dioxide at $40-$80 a tonne by 2020.</p><p></p><p>Many economists have described climate change as an example of market failure, as unbounded capitalism has so far failed to curb rising pollution. Global warming puts a huge cost and risk on future generations who will suffer the consequences, without these costs and risks being reflected in market prices.</p><p></p><p><a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/air-pollution/news/air-pollution-almost-as-bad-for-babies-as-smoking-during-pregnancy/">Air pollution almost as bad for babies as smoking during pregnancy</a></p><p></p><p>Dirty air can lead to women giving birth to smaller babies, according to new research which also warns that exposure to air pollution during pregnancy rivals the damage done by smoking.</p><p></p><p>文件 EURACOM020170904ed940002v</p><p></p><p><img src="data:image/gif;base64,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" /></p><p></p><p><a id="toc34"></a><strong>5% chance to save the world as we know it, says new climate study</strong></p><p></p><p>Oliver Milmann </p><p>1,179 字</p><p>2017 年 8 月 1 日 13:09</p><p>EurActiv.com</p><p>EURACOM</p><p>英文</p><p>Copyright 2017.

The public should be very concerned.”</p><p></p><p>Governments settled on the 2C threshold partly through political expediency but also because scientists have warned of severe consequences from sea level rise, drought, heatwaves and social unrest should the temperature rise beyond this.</p><p></p><p>Such risks have been underscored by a separate study, also released on Monday (31 July), that shows unabated climate change will cause around 60,000 deaths globally in 2030 and 260,000 deaths by 2100.</p><p></p><p><a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/air-pollution/news/fossil-fuel-subsidies-racking-up-trillions-in-health-costs/">Fossil fuel subsidies racking up trillions in health costs</a></p><p></p><p>Health costs related to fossil fuel use outweigh taxpayer-funded subsidies by 600%, according to a new study that insists governments should stop pumping money into dirty energy sources.</p><p></p><p>The study, by the University of North Carolina, found that rising temperatures will exacerbate air pollutants that will particularly threaten those with existing conditions.</p><p></p><p>According to the University of Washington study, there is a 90% likelihood that temperatures will rise between 2C and 4.9C by 2100. This would put the world in the mid-range warming <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/syr/AR5_SYR_FINAL_SPM.pdf">scenarios</a> mapped out by the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.</p><p></p><p>It negates the most optimistic outcome as well as the worst case, which would see temperatures climb nearly 6C beyond the pre-industrial era.</p><p></p><p>Rather than look at how greenhouse gases will influence temperature, the new research analysed the past 50 years of trends in world population, per capita gross domestic product (GDP) and carbon intensity, which is the amount of carbon dioxide emitted for each dollar of economic activity.</p><p></p><p>After building a statistical model covering a range of emissions scenarios, the researchers found that carbon intensity will be a crucial factor in future warming.</p><p></p><p><a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/air-pollution/news/daily-emissions-of-cruise-ships-same-as-one-million-cars/">Daily emissions of cruise ships same as one million cars</a></p><p></p><p>Cruise ships can emit as much particulate matter as a million cars every day and the air quality on deck can be as bad as the world’s most polluted cities, according to a new investigation.</p><p></p><p>Technological advances are expected to cut global carbon intensity by 90% over the course of the century, with sharp declines in China and India – two newly voracious consumers of energy. However, this decline still will not be steep enough to avoid breaching the 2C limit.</p><p></p><p>The world’s population is expected to grow to about 11 billion people by 2100, but the research found that this will have a relatively small impact upon temperatures as much of this growth will take place in sub-Saharan Africa, which is a minor contributor of greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p></p><p>It has long been acknowledged that emissions cuts promised under the the Paris Agreement would not be sufficient to avoid 2C warming. However, it is hoped that periodic reviews of commitments will result in more severe reductions.</p><p></p><p>Donald Trump’s pledge to remove the US, the world’s second-largest emitter, from the accord has cast a large shadow over these ambitions.</p><p></p><p>“Even if the 2C target isn’t met, action is very important,” said Raftery. “The more the temperature increases, the worse the impacts will be.</p><p></p><p>“We would warn against any tendency to use our results to say that we won’t avoid 2C, and so it’s too late to do anything. On the contrary, avoiding the higher temperature increases that our model envisages is even more important, and also requires urgent action.”</p><p></p><p>Raftery acknowledged that a breakthrough technology could “dramatically” change the outlook but noted that major advances of the past 50 years, such as the computer, robotics, hybrid cars, the internet and electronic fuel injection, have improved carbon efficiency steadily at around 2% a year, rather than in huge jumps.</p><p></p><p>Andrew Dessler, a climate scientist at Texas A&amp;M University who was not involved in the study, said the research’s conclusions were “reasonable” but said it was difficult to assign a precise probability to future temperature rises.</p><p></p><p>“I agree that staying below 2C and 1.5C are unlikely and very, very unlikely, respectively,” he said. “But this research gives a false sense of rigor. Tomorrow someone could invent a carbon-free energy source that everyone adopts.</p><p></p><p>“If you look at technology adoption and action taken on the ozone layer and acid rain, it’s clear these things can change faster than people predict.”</p><p></p><p>Dessler said the falling cost of renewable energy would be a major factor in reducing emissions but further impetus would be needed through new actions such as a price on carbon.</p><p></p><p><a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/energy/news/almost-90-of-new-energy-in-europe-from-renewable-sources-in-2016/">Almost 90% of new energy in Europe came from renewable sources in 2016</a></p><p></p><p>Renewable energy made up nearly nine-tenths of new power added to Europe’s electricity grids last year, in a sign of the continent’s rapid shift away from fossil fuels. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/feb/09/new-energy-europe-renewable-sources-2016">Euractiv’s media partner The Guardian reports</a>.</p><p></p><p>“It’s like you’re driving and about to collide with the car in front of you,” he said. “You want to hit the brakes as fast as you can. The later you wait, the more painful it’s going to be.”</p><p></p><p>John Sterman, an academic at the MIT Sloan Sustainability Initiative, said the research was an “urgent call to action”. MIT research has shown that emissions cuts in the Paris Agreement would stave off around 1C of temperature increase by 2100 – findings <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2017/mit-issues-statement-research-paris-agreement-0602">misrepresented by Trump</a> when he announced the US departure from the pact.</p><p></p><p>Sterman said the US must “dramatically speed the deployment of renewable energy and especially energy efficiency. Fortunately, renewables, storage and other technologies are already cheaper than fossil energy in many places and costs are falling fast.</p><p></p><p>“More aggressive policies are urgently needed, but this study should not be taken as evidence that nothing can be done.”</p><p></p><p>文件 EURACOM020170801ed810002u</p><p></p><p><img src="data:image/gif;base64,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" /></p><p></p><p><a id="toc35"></a><strong>Trump says ‘something could happen’ with Paris climate accord</strong></p><p></p><p>Georgi Gotev </p><p>1,284 字</p><p>2017 年 7 月 14 日 12:35</p><p>EurActiv.com</p><p>EURACOM</p><p>英文</p><p>Copyright 2017.

But Berlin’s representatives are not convinced by the East Asia superpower’s potential for climate change leadership.</p><p></p><p>Although adhering to the Paris Agreement offers the chance to reap major economic benefits, the German diplomats warned that: “For the time being, China is content with its unprecedented boost in reputation, which has come about thanks to China being “steadfast” in its commitments.”</p><p></p><p><a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/climate-environment/news/g20-leaders-statement-on-climate-change-highlights-rift-with-us/">G20 leaders' statement on climate change highlights rift with US</a></p><p></p><p>Joint statement points to US decision to withdraw from Paris agreement while other G20 countries see accord as ‘irreversible’, EURACTIV’s media partner The Guardian, reports.</p><p></p><p>Many state-owned companies are under considerable pressure not to develop further or increase the scale of their climate ambitions, because they have “much to lose”, the diplomatic paper claims.</p><p></p><p>The diplomats added that there is nothing to currently suggest that China will act differently in international climate negotiations than before and Beijing will remain a “tough negotiating partner”.</p><p></p><p>The most important piece of advice to emerge from the German contingent was the insistence that Belin should “intensify climate protection cooperation with China, as per the Petersberg Dialogue in May, thus preparing the ground for China to pursue its own interests in the Paris deal (economic potential, globalisation, environmental dividends) without the US there”.</p><p></p><p>Berlin’s diplomats are also convinced that China should pressure the European Union to increase its own climate efforts in order to compensate for the failure of the United States.</p><p></p><p>Germany’s environment chief, Barbara Hendricks (SPD), is also convinced that China, the EU, Canada and other countries should now take the point on climate leadership.</p><p></p><p>In an interview with <a href="http://www.tagesspiegel.de/politik/umweltministerin-barbara-hendricks-trump-zwingt-deutschland-in-fuehrungsrolle/19879238.html">Der Tagesspiegel</a>, she downplayed an alleged early breakdown in the EU-China axis at a recent summit, in which a declaration on the climate was prepared but not adopted.</p><p></p><p>Hendricks said that: “Both China and the EU have understood that active climate protection policies are modernising their economies, creating jobs and security, and safeguarding health and prosperity.” Both parties have ratified the Paris Agreement.</p><p></p><p>“They were and still are a part of the agreement but other reasons meant there was no clarification at the summit to cover climate protection. They will up their cooperation independently,” she added.</p><p></p><p>China’s five-year-plan to expand renewable energies and electro-mobility is ambitious.

EurActiv.com All Rights Reserved. </p><p></p><p>The EU should throw its full weight behind the UN’s 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and take a global lead in its implementation. Former President of the European Council Herman Van Rompuy and Mark Dubrulle explain why sustainable development should be the bloc’s top priority.</p><p></p><p>Herman Van Rompuy was the prime minister of Belgium and the first president of the European Council. He contributed this opinion piece in his capacity as honorary president of EU-Chapter of The Club of Rome. Mark Dubrulle is an ex officio member of The Club of Rome and the President of The Club of Rome EU-Chapter.</p><p></p><p>The conclusions of the General Affairs Council on 20 June could not be clearer. The first paragraph reads: “The Council underlines that sustainable development lies at the core of the European values and constitutes an overarching objective of the EU as set out in the Treaties”.  How many citizens know that this is enshrined in our Treaties?</p><p></p><p>The conclusions also “recall the leading role of the EU and its member states in the process that led to the adoption of 2030 Agenda for sustainable development”.</p><p></p><p>The Council “recognises that social and economic development depends on the sustainable management of our planet’s natural resources and that biodiversity is a critical foundation of earth’s life support system.”</p><p></p><p>The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, adopted by heads of state at the UN in September 2015 is at least as important as the Paris climate deal. It is a unique global agreement.</p><p></p><p>It offers the long overdue integration and combination development cooperation policies with sustainability policies. These grew separately over the past decades. Of course, there are not two kinds of development: one sustainable, the other neglecting sustainability. There can only be one.</p><p></p><p>Everything the Agenda 2030 contains is relevant for all citizens expecting the political world to listen to their calls. As summarised by Ban Ki Moon, it is dealing with “people, planet, prosperity, peace, and partnership”.</p><p></p><p>It is no longer just an agenda from the north for the south. It is a universal agenda, comprising targets and actions to be taken both in the developed countries and in the developing world. Agenda 2030 was not only a consensual text agreed by all the UN member states, it was also the subject of national and regional consultations involving civil societies.</p><p></p><p>It was critically analysed and advised by the Sustainable Development Solutions Network, thrown into the global social media.</p><p></p><p>The EU is showing remarkable leadership on the climate dossier. Not only has it over-performed on its 2020 greenhouse gas reduction targets, it is clearly taking over, together with China, the lead in the implementation of the global Paris climate agreement. The same leadership must now be exerted by the EU on the implementation of Agenda 2030.</p><p></p><p>This agenda is all-encompassing. It is not overly ambitious. Nothing in this text constrains the UN member states to do it all at once. The implementation will be done gradually.</p><p></p><p>The strong call means that we should abandon conducting policies in silos, such as regarding environment issues unconnected from the growing insecurity in the world, or seeing economic progress as a parallel issue to better social systems. Positive arguments for a strong EU-lead in implementing Agenda 2030 is of course much more convincing. The citizens want an EU with tangible results improving their life quality, welfare and well-being.</p><p></p><p>Agenda 2030 examples</p><p></p><p>Who would not agree with the target “Implement nationally appropriate social protection systems and measures for all, including floors, and by 2030 achieve substantial coverage of the poor and the vulnerable”?</p><p></p><p>Or not stand behind the target to ensure equal access for all women and men to affordable and quality technical, vocational and tertiary education, including university?</p><p></p><p>Which national or European politician would not feel compelled to try to “…achieve full and productive employment and decent work for all women and men, including for young people and persons with disabilities, and equal pay for work of equal value”?</p><p></p><p>Of course, obstacles will be enormous. But on so many other issues, the EU is already strongly leading and has actively influenced the Agenda 2030 in its drafting.</p><p></p><p>Agenda 2030 not only offers a “wonderful way forward”, but is the only possible one. The Club of Rome EU-Chapter is very sensitive to the target “Improve progressively, through 2030, global resource efficiency in consumption and production and endeavour to decouple economic growth from environmental degradation, in accordance with the 10-Year Framework of Programs on Sustainable Consumption and Production”.</p><p></p><p>The only economy that has a future is the circular economy. By 2030, many mineral resources will be scarce. The extractable amount per year will have started declining in absolute numbers. Currently, the EU is overconsuming natural resources for maintaining unsustainable lifestyles: there is a need for absolute decoupling, capping the use of resources.</p><p></p><p>We salute the fact that the Council unanimously urged, in its session of 20 June, the Commission “to elaborate, by mid-2018, an implementation strategy in all relevant EU internal and external policies”.</p><p></p><p>We agree with the call by the Council “to identify existing gaps in all relevant policy areas to assess what more needs to be done until 2030 in terms of EU policy, legislation, governance structure for horizontal coherence and means of implementation”.</p><p></p><p>And we stand fully behind the Council’s call to the Commission to already “define a clear process for consideration of the SDGs and their integration in post-2020 policies, in consultation with all relevant stakeholders along the process “.</p><p></p><p>For sure, we should recognise the difficult challenges that must be overcome to implement the Agenda 2030. But from a strategic point of view, the Commission should take the 2030 Agenda and the SDGs as guiding principle in all their upcoming reviews of the major horizontal policy instruments and reflections on the future of Europe.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, the EU stops being the frontrunner in terms of sustainability, with losses that exceed the perceived gains of waiting ‘a little longer’.</p><p></p><p>The EU must be bold. Staying behind the Council’s conclusions is losing.</p><p></p><p>文件 EURACOM020170628ed6s0008f</p><p></p><p><img src="data:image/gif;base64,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" /></p><p></p><p><a id="toc38"></a><strong>SMEs are key to inclusive trade, say global experts</strong></p><p></p><p>Daniela Vincenti </p><p>652 字</p><p>2017 年 6 月 16 日 20:58</p><p>EurActiv.com</p><p>EURACOM</p><p>英文</p><p>Copyright 2017. EurActiv.com All Rights Reserved. </p><p></p><p>Trade has become a scapegoat for complex challenges and many countries, such as the US and the UK, have withdrawn into protectionism. Experts say SMEs should be the starting point for more inclusive global trade and more responsible supply chains.</p><p></p><p>“Open trade, rooted in multilateral institutions like the WTO, remains the best way forward. But market opening alone is not enough,” said Arancha Gonzáles, executive director at the International Trade Centre, in Brussels on Thursday (15 June).</p><p></p><p>“Protectionism is an intellectually lazy answer to the challenges posed by globalisation,” she added, pushing for new ideas to mainstream sustainability across the global supply chain.</p><p></p><p>Gonzáles’ remarks came as the UK heads toward negotiations to exit the European Union and Donald Trump withdrew the United States from the Paris climate agreement.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, the EU has issued its own mea culpa and begun pushing for the benefits of globalisation to be shared more equally. In a <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/sites/beta-political/files/reflection-paper-globalisation_en.pdf">reflection paper on harnessing globalisation</a> published in May, the European Commission noted that the free flow of goods and capital is no longer an absolute source of prosperity: it is a wild reality to be harnessed in order to control its intrinsically dark nature.</p><p></p><p><a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/economy-jobs/news/eu-facing-up-to-deficits-of-globalisation/">EU facing up to deficits of globalisation</a></p><p></p><p>After almost two decades of neglecting the flaws of free trade, the European Commission admitted yesterday (10 May) that it is high time to share the benefits of globalisation.</p><p></p><p>According to free trade advocates, protectionism would reduce purchasing power and weaken productivity growth by decreasing specialisation, competition, and scale.</p><p></p><p>“It might save a factory here and there, but at the cost of making entire societies poorer than they otherwise would have been,” Gonzáles said.</p><p></p><p>It is then crucial to make trade more inclusive so that everybody benefits from globalisation, starting with the participation in the global marketplace of the businesses that employ the vast majority of the workforce.</p><p></p><p><a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/social-europe-jobs/news/davos-warns-squeezed-middle-class-needs-attention/">Davos warns ‘squeezed’ middle class needs attention</a></p><p></p><p>Threatened by unemployment and stagnant wages, the middle class is increasingly feeling the pinch and falling prey to populism, as shown in recent elections and the Brexit vote, international and business leaders in Davos warned.</p><p></p><p>Here, Germany’s Mittelstand stands as the iconic symbol of how a globally connected SME sector is closely tied into bigger companies’ value chains.</p><p></p><p>Cutting fixed costs</p><p></p><p>“SMEs can increase economic dynamism while fostering a more equitable distribution of the fruits of growth,” said the ITC executive director.</p><p></p><p>To make that happen experts value policies that reduce fixed costs related to trade, like complex border procedures and the need to meet various product standards.</p><p></p><p>Christian Ewert, the Foreign Trade Association director general, notes that there needs to be an alignment of standards across different global trade regions, including China.</p><p></p><p>Businesses and governments should not be afraid of China participating in setting standards, rather the contrary, he said. Pushing China to come up with their own standards is counterproductive and it is better to start an inclusive process to which they can contribute, Ewert insisted.</p><p></p><p>The complex variety of sustainability standards is a no way street and a real handicap for SMEs, agreed Gonzáles. “Inclusive trade means setting norms that are not unnecessarily complicated,” she said.</p><p></p><p>Standard-setting is basically no longer the remit of government agencies alone.

EurActiv.com All Rights Reserved. </p><p></p><p>Ad hoc measures won’t be enough to fight climate change. The EU needs to step up and the ECB should start pumping some of its €60 billion monthly investments into green projects, insists MEP Neena Gill.</p><p></p><p>Neena Gill CBE is a British MEP with the S&amp;D group and represents the Labour Party at national level.</p><p></p><p>Trump’s decision to wrench the world’s largest superpower out of the Paris climate change agreement could have a catastrophic and lasting impact on future generations.</p><p></p><p>Bafflingly, much of the international community has responded to his decision with a shrug of their shoulders. Many believe it is too late for the Trump administration to stop the world’s progression into a green economy because many private, profit driven companies have now accepted the green agenda.</p><p></p><p>Oh to be an optimist; I view this attitude as dangerously complacent. The truth is that even with the US in the Paris agreement, only a thin sheet of ice separated us from global environmental disaster.</p><p></p><p>The €23 billion invested globally each month into clean energy investments leaves us a long way off from meeting the IEA’s target of 13.5 trillion climate investment by 2030. Now that the US has stepped back – and this figure likely to reduce – society as we know it faces an existential threat.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention that by tearing up the diplomatic agreement, the danger is that the US has created an excuse for other reluctant co-signatories to bail out of the agreement.</p><p></p><p>Before the floods start rising, let’s at least put the EU on the right side of history and take the lead. Two things need to be done right now: a clear definition of what constitutes ‘green’ in projects and investments, and then, using these terms, the creation a critical mass of funding that is sufficient for tackling the problem.</p><p></p><p>Research has shown that massively underperforming investment products are being given the green label. A robust definition of green will not only re-focus government investment in the right direction.</p><p></p><p>Consumers will also be encouraged to invest their savings and pensions in sustainable solutions. More than 80% of household assets are long term investments. So it makes sense financially for them to coincide with long-term sustainable objectives.</p><p></p><p>With the US turning inwards, it is vital that the EU <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/transparency/regexpert/index.cfm?do=groupDetail.groupDetail&amp;groupID=3485">Commission’s High Level Expert Group</a> on Sustainable Finance takes the lead by presenting bold and ambitious definitions and a plan of action when it presents its mid-term conclusions in July. With this, the EU can begin to focus the investment in the right direction.</p><p></p><p>The cost of fighting climate change is expensive. Switching fossil fuels for low-carbon energy sources alone will cost $44 trillion between now and 2050, according to <a href="http://www.iea.org/etp/">a 2014 report</a> by <a href="http://www.iea.org/">International Energy Agency</a>.</p><p></p><p>To hit this target, rather than using ad hoc measures (like green criteria in IORPS and in STS regulation), it is necessary to mainstream the green ideas in all our capital flows and regulations. To do this, the EU has to go a step further on the macro-economic level.</p><p></p><p>That’s why last week I urged ECB President Mario Draghi to use more of the ECB’s €60 billion monthly investment in quantitative easing for green purposes. When ratifying the COP21 climate change agreement, G20 leaders called for “clear, strategic policy signals.”</p><p></p><p>The ECB’s own mandate supports “a high level of protection and improvement of the quality of the environment.” So why can’t the ECB target its quantitative easing program – or at least a large percentage of it – at green investments?</p><p></p><p>Draghi’s response was disappointing given the urgency of the problem. The asset purchase programme of buying corporate bonds – part of the ECB’s quantitative easing – was designed out of pure monetary policy as well as for risk management reasons.</p><p></p><p>I understand concerns that deliberately favouring green investment could compromise the fundamental requirement of having a level playing field, leading to economic risk. However, the argument for more green investment can be made without compromising the ECB’s sector neutrality.</p><p></p><p>It simply needs to take the economic risk of stranded assets more seriously. Changes in government regulation, or even legal action could result in non-green assets becoming stranded.</p><p></p><p>In response to my questioning, the ECB president did stress that within this framework investment programs are open to companies issuing green bonds. However, the concern is that we do not know what percentage of this investment is currently green.</p><p></p><p>At present, national central banks in the eurozone buy the bonds on behalf of the ECB but the size of their investments is not declared. A transparent review of how to better align ECB injections with the goal of funding a low-carbon economy is critical.</p><p></p><p>Monetary policy is important, but it is just a tool to serve society. It must not prevent us from investing in sustainable long term solutions for the future of our planet. To tackle climate change the EU needs joined-up, bold thinking, as well as transparent investment.</p><p></p><p>Already, the European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI) is taking a lead in this area. Yesterday Vice-President of the EFSI Dombrovskis said “The world can count on us for global leadership in the fight against climate change.”</p><p></p><p>To be a real success though, green investment must not only come from individual bodies like the EFSI and the ECB, but from broader frameworks, including the Commission’s flagship <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/economic-and-fiscal-policy-coordination/eu-economic-governance-monitoring-prevention-correction/stability-and-growth-pact_en">Stability and Growth Pact</a> (SGP).</p><p></p><p>Finance is too often overlooked by environmentalists. If we are to keep the planet safe from disaster, we need to mainstream green investment, not isolate it as a niche pursuit.</p><p></p><p>As well as encouraging different European institutions and bodies to work together to resist climate change, we need to join up our environmental strategy with our external action partners.</p><p></p><p>Even when the US leaves the Paris climate agreement, 194 of the world’s 197 nations will still be signed up to the agreement.</p><p></p><p>The EU-China joint summit last Friday showed promise in the battle for a sustainable future, as they promised to work together on strategies to tackle climate change, including cooperation on regulation and legislation.</p><p></p><p>For every step back that the US administration takes back away from tackling climate change, the EU and its allies must take three steps forward.</p><p></p><p>文件 EURACOM020170608ed680002u</p><p></p><p><img src="data:image/gif;base64,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" /></p><p></p><p><a id="toc40"></a><strong>Coal sector alone in celebrating US exit from Paris Agreement</strong></p><p></p><p>Romain Loury </p><p>464 字</p><p>2017 年 6 月 7 日 20:55</p><p>EurActiv.com</p><p>EURACOM</p><p>英文</p><p>Copyright 2017.

Foreign investment opportunities, he said, were far different from when China first opened up its market.</p><p></p><p>“I do hope you can put things into context. We find the problems, but we are working on them … Our ranking is getting better,” he said, noting that despite slower growth, the size of the Chinese economy pumps more into trade than is often perceived. “Every year there are more than 13 million new jobs being created,” he added.</p><p></p><p>“The future for China and Europe will be bright and splendid,” PM Li concluded.</p><p></p><p>A number of Chinese businessmen reiterated Li’s message.

So you are used to rules, but in developing countries rule-making is perceived differently,” Feng added.</p><p></p><p>“You need to allow time to China and understand each other better,” he continued.</p><p></p><p>The two partners are determined to use the EU-China Tourism Year next year to increase visitor flows and investment on both sides, but also as an occasion for greater cultural exchange.</p><p></p><p>文件 EURACOM020170602ed620008f</p><p></p><p><img src="data:image/gif;base64,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" /></p><p></p><p><a id="toc45"></a><strong>The Brief: Did France’s spaceman see the stars aligning?</strong></p><p></p><p>Georgi Gotev </p><p>699 字</p><p>2017 年 6 月 2 日 23:01</p><p>EurActiv.com</p><p>EURACOM</p><p>英文</p><p>Copyright 2017.

Donald Trump’s announcement that he is ditching the <a href="http://www.euractiv.com/section/climate-environment/news/axios-trump-pulling-u-s-out-of-paris-climate-deal/">Paris climate agreement</a> was expected. And Emmanuel Macron seized the occasion to position himself as the new global leader.</p><p></p><p>Macron’s unusual speech in English and <a href="https://twitter.com/EmmanuelMacron/status/870407981044834304">his amazing tweet</a> “Make our planet great again!” were extremely well thought out. No similar reaction came from Berlin, and nothing of note from the EU institutions.</p><p></p><p>The French president acted as though the exit from the Paris Agreement was an affront directed at France itself. Which it was: in his <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/870412262900740096">Rose Garden speech</a>, Trump mentioned Paris twice, once to say he cared more about Pittsburgh (The latter’s mayor quickly replied to <a href="https://twitter.com/billpeduto/status/870370288344674304">Trump on Twitter</a>).</p><p></p><p>This comes in very handy. The French will vote in legislative elections on 11 and 18 June, and Macron’s party is already <a href="http://www.euractiv.com/section/elections/news/macrons-party-seen-winning-majority-in-french-legislative-elections/">expected to win</a> the first round by <a href="https://twitter.com/LSEEuroppblog/status/870604344533688321">a hefty margin</a>. Many Frenchmen who are not among Macron’s supporters will not fail to notice that their president is rising to be a world leader.</p><p></p><p>Who would have thought a party created just over a year ago could be so successful? And who would have thought Macron himself, who had never even stood for election before, would be president?</p><p></p><p>Today, French astronaut Thomas Pesquet <a href="https://twitter.com/m6info/status/870646928471621636">returned to Earth</a>. When he took off on 17 November 2016, it probably didn’t even register that Macron announced his candidacy <a href="http://www.euractiv.com/section/elections/news/emmanuel-macron-officially-enters-the-french-presidential-race/">the previous day</a>.</p><p></p><p>Pesquet took a lot of amazing photos from space and posted <a href="https://twitter.com/Thom_astro">them on Twitter</a>. Maybe he saw the stars aligning for Macron?</p><p></p><p>When he departed for the International Space Station, Alain Juppé was still the favourite. A few days later François Fillon won the centre-right primary by a surprising margin.</p><p></p><p>Many of us saw Fillon as president at that time. But he was then condemned to political obscurity by a number of scandals, while the Socialists put up a candidate without any chance of making it to the second round.</p><p></p><p>When he was choosing his commanders, Napoleon famously said “I know he’s a good general, but<a href="http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/812087-i-know-he-s-a-good-general-but-is-he-lucky"> is he lucky?</a>” Yes, Macron is lucky. With the Rose Garden announcement, Trump couldn’t have handed him a bigger present.</p><p></p><p>Welcome back to Earth, Thomas Pesquet. And thank you for your amazing photos showing how fragile our planet is.</p><p></p><p>The Roundup</p><p></p><p>European Council President Donald Tusk warned leaving the Paris deal is a bigger mistake than not ratifying <a href="https://twitter.com/jameskanter/status/870637566109904896">the Kyoto Agreement</a>, while Canadian PM Justin Trudeau chose his words carefully and said he was “disappointed in the United <a href="https://twitter.com/JustinTrudeau/status/870386250762645504">States federal government</a>”.</p><p></p><p>German media came out with some <a href="https://twitter.com/SamJamesMorgan/status/870632226882564096">great front pages</a> to mark the US turning its back on the agreement.

He then tweeted that he would make an announcement this week.</p><p></p><p>Fox News also cited an unidentified source confirming the pullout.</p><p></p><p>The decision will put the United States in league with Syria and Nicaragua as the world’s only non-participants in the Paris Agreement. It could have sweeping implications for the deal, which relies heavily on the commitment of big polluter nations to reduce emissions of gases scientists blame for sea level rise, droughts and more frequent violent storms.</p><p></p><p>The accord, agreed on by nearly 200 countries in Paris in 2015, aims to limit planetary warming in part by slashing carbon dioxide and other emissions from the burning of fossil fuels. Under the pact, the United States committed to reducing its emissions by 26 to 28 percent from 2005 levels by 2025.</p><p></p><p><a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/global-europe/news/trump-still-not-backing-paris-climate-agreement/">Trump still not backing Paris climate agreement</a></p><p></p><p>President Donald Trump still refuses to back the 2015 Paris agreement to fight climate change, blocking efforts by world leaders meeting in Sicily to get the new US leader to endorse the treaty, Italy’s prime minister said today (26 May).</p><p></p><p>Axios said details of the pullout are being worked out by a team that includes EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt. The choice is between a formal withdrawal that could take three years or leaving the UN treaty that the accord is based on, which would be quicker but more extreme, according to Axios.</p><p></p><p>The decision to withdraw from the climate accord was influenced by a letter from 22 Republican US senators, including Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, calling for an exit, Axios reported.</p><p></p><p>Former President Barack Obama, who helped broker the accord, praised the accord during a trip to Europe this month.</p><p></p><p>The United States is the world’s second-biggest carbon dioxide emitter behind China.</p><p></p><p><a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/climate-environment/news/tillerson-gives-nod-to-paris-agreement-at-arctic-council-meeting/">Tillerson gives nod to Paris Agreement at Arctic Council meeting</a></p><p></p><p>US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson signed an agreement recognising the landmark Paris climate accord at a meeting of Arctic nations in Alaska on Wednesday (10 May) but said President Trump was not rushing to decide whether to leave or weaken US commitments to the pact.</p><p></p><p>Supporters of the climate pact are concerned that a US exit could lead other nations to weaken their commitments or also withdraw, softening an accord that scientists have said is critical to avoiding the worst impacts of climate change.</p><p></p><p>Canada, the European Union, and China have said they will honour their commitments to the pact even if the United States withdraws.

As China has grown, so has the involvement of European companies.</p><p></p><p>As of 2015, the EU’s total outward foreign direct investment stock in China was €168 billion, with exports to China totaling €170 billion in 2016. China is the EU’s second trading partner after the US, with a share of 20% in our imports and 10% in our exports.</p><p></p><p>In addition to market access limitations, foreign investors cite a number challenges to establishing and operating businesses in China. These include: rising costs in doing business; difficulty in finding qualified human resources; unclear and inconsistent enforcement of laws and regulations; corruption; opaque and selectively enforced investment approval procedures; licensing barriers that favour domestic firms; an unreliable legal system; lack of effective administrative and legal resources; forced transfer of technology and new barriers on cross border data flows. The list goes on.</p><p></p><p>“China demonstrates leadership when it is needed, “ BusinessEurope director general told EURACTIV, mentioning last years’ G20, the Paris Climate Agreement and President Xi’s defence of globalisation, as well as his push to major multilateral institutions to join China’s One Belt, One Road Initiative (OBOR) just in May.</p><p></p><p>“But we need to see more action from China, more engagement in bilateral and multilateral trade discussions, more willingness to commit,” he added.</p><p></p><p>Ambassador Yang Yanyi said China is ready to add new dimensions to the cooperation between the two economic partners.</p><p></p><p>“For instance, given that China has embarked on an ambitious transition to a new model of economic development based on innovation, and innovation remains essential in the European integration process, we should make it a high priority to enhance cooperation in science and technology and innovation,” the Ambassador said.</p><p></p><p>“There is also the need to further promote cooperation between small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and give full play to their role as principal driving forces in economic development and regional integration.”</p><p></p><p>China’s economic repositioning, through the OBOR, signals a global infrastructure spending spree worth an estimated $1 trillion.</p><p></p><p>“Not surprisingly, the US and Japan are not pleased. Most Europeans are interested but cautious,” said Shada Islam, director of Europe and geopolitics at Friends of Europe.</p><p></p><p>And rightly so. <a href="http://thediplomat.com/2017/05/the-problem-with-chinas-one-belt-one-road-strategy/">Research has found</a> that large infrastructure projects delivered in China have a patchy record. Half were poorly managed, featuring cost overruns, lack of real economic benefit in the areas where they were built, and little in the way of returns to investors.</p><p></p><p>“China may not always be the gentlest of interlocutors, but many countries are ready for a change,” added Islam.</p><p></p><p>“After all the world needs to get better connected. Global infrastructure needs are enormous. Better connectivity is crucial for trade, to attract investments and to achieve some of the most crucial anti-poverty goals included in the Agenda 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs),” she continued.</p><p></p><p>Some analysts are confident that steel overcapacity can be addressed through the OBOR projects. Thousands of jobs will be created for Chinese workers, as well as foreign nationals, noted Islam.</p><p></p><p>“The way ahead is going to be complicated and difficult. China will need to learn how to deal with complex demands and painful facts on the ground in its myriad partner countries,” Islam concluded.</p><p></p><p>Chinese interest in the investment treaty is essentially driven by the willingness to protect its offensive interests in FDI projects in the EU, said Pascal Kerneis, heading the European Services Forum. “The agreement with the EU is the natural prolongation, if not the final destination of the OBOR initiative. But to succeed, the talks will need to deliver both ways” he insisted.</p><p></p><p>The potential is there and the EU-China summit this week will be a testing ground for a new start, if the two partners are really serious about making a difference, as the Ambassador seems to believe.</p><p></p><p><a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/economy-jobs/opinion/china-and-europe-together-we-can-make-a-difference/">China and Europe: Together we can make a difference</a></p><p></p><p>Ahead of the Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation (BRF), to be held in Beijing this weekend, H.E.

EurActiv.com All Rights Reserved. </p><p></p><p>Spain's former foreign minister, José Manuel García-Margallo, <a href="http://euroefe.euractiv.es/5861_protagonistas/4157410_margallo-es-probable-que-trump-no-cumpla-parte-de-su-programa-insh-allah.html#">told EurActiv Spain</a> that now is not the time for alarmist reactions to Donald Trump's US election victory and that Brexit could provide Spain with an opportunity to increase its international standing. José Manuel García-Margallo was Spain's minister for foreign affairs and cooperation from 2011 to 2016. He spoke to EurActiv Spain's Catalina Guerrero and Belén Anca. García-Margallo was the head of Spanish diplomacy until a few days ago, when he was replaced in Mariano Rajoy's new cabinet. He is optimistic that Trump's presidency will not be as disruptive as his campaign promises might lead people to believe and there have already been the "first signs" of this.</p><p></p><p> These signs, while still "worrying", appear to show that Trump is already backtracking, given that his initial promise to deport 11 million people has now been downgraded to two or three million people with criminal records. "It is outrageous, but less so," said García-Margallo. He also cited Trump's promise to build a wall in Mexico, which has now been revised to a border fence. His pledge to prohibit Muslims from entering the US has also not been given much more airtime. Regarding international politics, García-Margallo is equally confident that Trump's grandstanding on issues like the Iran nuclear deal and the Paris climate agreement will not materialise into actual policy shifts, as both issues are "not bilateral agreements with the US, they are covered by the UN". https://www.euractiv.com/section/global-europe/news/global-flashpoints-react-to-trump-victory/ The erstwhile foreign minister, who backed Hillary Clinton in the race to the White House, added that now is not the time for alarmist reactions. Instead, what is important now are the "opportunities" that will open up for the EU and Spain. One of these will be in the sector of defence. "Since the Cold War, the US has been the sheriff of the county and we've just been the lounge pianist. <a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/global-europe/news/eu-backs-minimalist-defence-plan-in-effort-not-to-undermine-nato/">That's over now</a>," insisted García-Margallo, who has just published a <a href="http://www.planetadelibros.com/libro-europa-y-el-porvenir/231081">book on the future of Europe</a>, co-written with Secretary of State for European Affairs Fernando Eguidazu. On one hand, there is "Libya, Syria and Iraq, which interest us much more than the US, and which are creating a refugee problem for us, especially in Greece." And, on the other, he added, there is "all of Eastern Europe, which fears that there is an understanding between Putin and Trump." https://www.euractiv.com/section/global-europe/news/putin-and-trump-speak-by-phone-aim-for-constructive-cooperation/ "Either we defend ourselves or there is no defence here," warned García-Margallo, who admitted that the fact that President-in-waiting <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/laurasilver/trump-and-farage-going-for-gold">Trump's first photo</a> with a European politician was with UKIP leader Nigel Farage sent a "very strong" signal. In terms of trade, García-Margallo believes that the EU-US TTIP deal will be "shelved for a long time" as a result of Trump's victory, while the much-criticised (especially by Trump) NAFTA agreement, which is "extraordinarily important" for Mexico, will not be renegotiated, despite what the president-elect said during his campaign. Neither does he believe that the US will move to impose tariffs on China and Mexico, as promised, because it is "contrary" to WTO rules. The winds of populism that are currently blowing across the continent show certain "parallels" with the events of the early 20th century, but the Spaniard hopes that France will act as a form of fire-break, in the form of Alain Juppé and his likely showdown with National Front leader Marine Le Pen next year. http://www.euractiv.com/section/uk-europe/news/spain-wants-uk-to-foot-healthcare-bill-for-british-citizens/ Furthermore, García-Margallo suggested that Spain may have been granted an opportunity in the form of Brexit. Discounting the issue of sovereignty over Gibraltar, the former minister is hopeful that if Madrid "plays its cards right" then Spain will be able to secure a "leading role" in Europe's relations with the US, as well as wresting control of the European Medicines Agency, the European Banking Authority and the EU's Clearing House away from London. Not to mention tempting multinational North American companies away from their UK bases. https://www.euractiv.com/section/uk-europe/news/paris-looks-to-take-advantage-of-brexit-chaos/ García-Margallo, who actually predicted Brexit and Trump's victory, now insists that "Spain cannot afford to be wrong when it comes to the US." He also hopes that his successor, Alfonso Dastis, will continue with the two linchpins of foreign policy that Spain has established: "Europe and transatlantic relations".&gt;</p><p></p><p>文件 EURACOM020161115ecbf0002v</p><p></p><p><img src="data:image/gif;base64,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" /></p><p></p><p><a id="toc49"></a><strong>Climate action after Paris: Tailwinds, headwinds and wild cards</strong></p><p></p><p>1,072 字</p><p>2016 年 11 月 4 日 21:13</p><p>EurActiv.com</p><p>EURACOM</p><p>英文</p><p>Copyright 2016. EurActiv.com All Rights Reserved. </p><p></p><p>As the Paris Climate Agreement enters into force, it is time to reflect on how the politics of climate change are evolving, writes Nick Mabey. Nick Mabey is Chief Executive of E3G, a European think tank promoting ‘Third Generation Environmentalism’. The Paris Agreement marks a break from the past. Argument over rules is largely over even though there are still important details to agree. Although it was the best deal available, the regime is far from perfect. Country commitments do not match the agreed goal of staying well below 2C, let alone the “stretch goal” of 1.5C. The ultimate success of the Paris regime will depend on whether its “ambition mechanism” works in practice. This is a five year political cycle where each country must simultaneously put forward increasingly ambitious emission reductions so we can collectively reach the Paris goals. The focus of global climate politics has shifted from agreeing rules to increasing ambition.</p><p></p><p> From how to share out the global carbon budget to influencing how fast countries believe they can shift to a zero-carbon economy. The politics of ambition will not be decided at the negotiating table. It will be determined by national debates driven by economic events rather than scientific knowledge. Traditionally rising greenhouse gas emissions were seen as being irrevocably linked to economic growth. Climate policy was a Sisyphean task of pushing a boulder up an ever steeper political and economic hill using ever more shocking scientific evidence. But decades of climate policy have produced a virtuous economic circle where delivering climate action shifts the balance of national interests towards more ambition. Going forward these drivers will provide the “tailwinds” which increase the space for ambitious climate action. Three tailwinds The first tailwind is the amazing cost reductions in clean technology; from renewable energy to battery storage to LED lighting. Costs have fallen 15 years faster than expected. Ironically it was the Copenhagen Summit which led to the pulse of EU clean technology investment which kickstarted cost-reduction though global supply chains. Perceptions of falling costs of climate action were vital to open the political space for the Paris Agreement only six years after the failure of Copenhagen. Expectations that technology prices will fall further are now encouraging greater investment in climate ambition and further price reductions. Cost reductions have been complemented by recognition of the multiple benefits of clean technologies; such as tackling air pollution, reducing fuel poverty, and increasing energy security. Cities are investing in clean energy for local and climate change benefits; delivering a bottom-up accelerator of climate action. Use of electric cars will be driven as much by a need to tackle air pollution as by climate concerns. The second tailwind is the mainstreaming of climate change into financial decision making. This has been driven by a pincer movement of NGO climate activism directed at large investors, and the destructive impact of clean technology on share values in high carbon sectors. Finance is notoriously risk averse. Before Paris most investors were ignoring the risks of an early move to a low carbon economy; now the burden of proof has shifted. Countries looking to attract private capital will increasingly need to ensure their infrastructure projects are aligned with a zero-carbon future. The third tailwind for climate ambition is the impact of climatic change itself on national debates. Major weather events are shifting politics in many countries. This is happening slower than expected because fossil fuel interests are still more politically powerful than climate impacted industries. Many richer countries also still think they are not themselves at risk. These dynamics are changing with the public in vulnerable developed countries like Spain and Greece now rating climate change as a more important threat than people in traditional “green” champions like Germany and Sweden. Three headwinds But these tailwinds are not the only forces at play. Denial of climate science is no longer a major force globally, except where aligned with broader populist movements. The real “headwinds” threatening faster climate action come from reactions to the very success of climate policy in shifting investment, markets and economic risk. The first headwind results from the poor management of inevitable impacts on jobs, communities, taxes and pension dividends as countries disentangle themselves from fossil-fuels. Those ideologically opposed to climate action will try and form coalitions with affected groups in order to slow the transition. A tactic already used by the National Front in France and UKIP in the UK. History shows that most industrial transitions are handled badly and public support mainly benefits companies not people. Better just transition policies are needed to avoid a social backlash. The second headwind is institutional inertia in existing market and regulatory systems. As clean technologies significantly penetrate markets they fundamentally disrupt exiting regulatory and business models. Major reforms will be needed to electricity and gas markets, infrastructure regulation, and public financial management in order to maintain services and investment. Incumbent interests are adept at inflating the risks of reform and suggesting incremental “patches” which actually support existing dirty assets. For example, subsidising old fossil plants to balance power systems rather than creating new markets for energy storage, smart controls and flexibility. The final and most difficult headwind to tackle is where fossil-based industries are critical to politicians’ core Party or individual interests. Repressive political action, even escalating into state violence, has already marked protests against the coal sector in many countries. Environmental repression and corruption will become more common as the low carbon transition accelerates. A wild card No matter how strong the headwinds in driving greater climate action they are still at risk from wider forces. The true wild card in climate politics is the broader geopolitical context for cooperation over the next decade. In Paris, the geopolitical stars aligned and the US and China used climate change cooperation to balance their other political differences. Whether similar luck will hold over the coming decade is unclear but much worse scenarios are plausible. Climate cooperation must be designed to ensure the resilience of the Paris regime through good political times and bad. The Paris Agreement was a success, but is not an outcome in itself. The next decade is the most fragile period for the new regime. We have built the scientific, economic, technological and financial foundations for maintaining a safe climate. We now need to build the politics.&gt;</p><p></p><p>文件 EURACOM020161104ecb40008i</p><p></p><p><img src="data:image/gif;base64,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" /></p><p></p><p><a id="toc50"></a><strong>World on track for 3C of warming under current global climate pledges, warns UN</strong></p><p></p><p>849 字</p><p>2016 年 11 月 3 日 21:45</p><p>EurActiv.com</p><p>EURACOM</p><p>英文</p><p>Copyright 2016. EurActiv.com All Rights Reserved. </p><p></p><p>The commitments made by governments on climate change will lead to dangerous levels of global warming because they are incommensurate with the growth of greenhouse gas emissions, according to a new report. The United Nations Environment Programme (Unep) said that pledges put forward to cut emissions would see temperatures rise by 3C above pre-industrial levels, far above the the 2C of the Paris climate agreement, which comes into force on Friday. At least a quarter must be cut from emissions by the end of the next decade, compared with current trends, the UN said. <a href="http://capacity4dev.ec.europa.eu/unep/document/emissions-gap-report-2016-unep-synthesis-report">The report</a> found that emissions by 2030 were likely to reach about 54 to 56 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent a year, a long way astray of the 42 gigatonnes a year likely to be the level at which warming exceeds 2C.</p><p></p><p> Erik Solheim, chief of Unep, said the world was “moving in the right direction” on reducing greenhouse gas emissions and tackling climate change, but that measures should be taken urgently to avoid the need for much more drastic cuts in emissions in future. “If we don’t start taking additional action now, we will grieve over the avoidable human tragedy.” <a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/development-policy/interview/weds-un-environment-chief-without-growth-there-can-be-no-end-to-poverty/">https://www.euractiv.com/section/development-policy/interview/weds-un-environment-chief-without-growth-there-can-be-no-end-to-poverty/</a> He warned in particular that people would start being displaced from their homes by the effects of climate change, suffering from drought, hunger, disease and conflicts arising from these afflictions. Mass migration as a result of climate change is hard to separate from other causes of migration, but is predicted to become a much greater problem. This year is “locked in” to be the hottest on record, according to Nasa, eclipsing last year’s record heat, and may show the way to future temperature rises and their accompanying problems. Under the Paris agreement, reached last December, all of the world’s functioning governments have agreed to reduce greenhouse gases in line with the need to hold warming to no more than 2C, which scientists consider the limit of safety. That agreement has been ratified by the US, China and the European Union, and several other governments. However, while all of the governments involved in the Paris accord have agreed their own domestic targets for curbing greenhouse gases, these are not legally binding. In addition, few countries have set out concrete plans for how they would implement the curbs. <a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/climate-environment/news/cop22-eu-climate-financing-still-only-theoretical/">https://www.euractiv.com/section/climate-environment/news/cop22-eu-climate-financing-still-only-theoretical/</a> Next week, signatories to the Paris agreement will gather in Marrakesh to flesh out some aspects of the pact reached last year. Supporters hope that some countries may come up with fuller plans for how they mean to achieve the necessary future emissions reductions, and countries that have not yet ratified the agreement will be persuaded to do so. None are expected to announce new targets on emissions in line with the reductions that the Unep report suggests are necessary. Nations currently have domestic targets on curbing or cutting emissions by 2020, set out in 2009 at the UN meeting in Copenhagen, as well as their Paris commitments which apply from 2025 to 2030. Asad Rehman, Friends of the Earth’s international climate campaigner, said: “This is a stark warning that cannot be ignored – tougher action on climate change is urgently needed to prevent the world speeding towards catastrophe. Governments are drinking in the ‘last chance saloon’ if the lofty goals of the Paris climate agreement are to be met.” <a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/transport/news/global-deal-to-curb-aviation-emissions-not-enough-meps-warn/">https://www.euractiv.com/section/transport/news/global-deal-to-curb-aviation-emissions-not-enough-meps-warn/</a> Richard Black, director of the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit thinktank, said: “Unep’s report confirms that there has been remarkable acceleration towards a global low-carbon economy over the past year, but considerably more action is required if governments are to meet the target they set under the Paris agreement.” Another significant climate agreement was signed in the last few weeks. Under the Montreal Protocol of 1987, countries agreed to phase out gases known to be harmful to the ozone layer. Some of the substitutes, however, turned out to be much more potent than carbon dioxide in warming the planet. Under a new addition to that agreement countries around the world have agreed to remove the harmful HFCs used in some air-conditioning and refrigeration systems. If fully implemented, this could result in a 0.5C reduction in future warming. Given the goal set in Paris for limiting global temperature rises to 2C, this would make a significant difference to the world’s actions on climate change if it is fully endorsed. Phasing out the relevant chemicals may take much of the rest of the decade, however, and could face resistance in some industries. Solheim urged countries to embark on more ambitious programmes to improve energy efficiency, increase the amount of energy coming from renewable sources, and look to meet the national targets they set in Paris.&gt;</p><p></p><p>文件 EURACOM020161104ecb30002y</p><p></p><p><img src="data:image/gif;base64,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" /></p><p></p><p><a id="toc51"></a><strong>EU overcomes sovereignty fears to secure deal on climate change</strong></p><p></p><p>943 字</p><p>2016 年 9 月 30 日 21:47</p><p>EurActiv.com</p><p>EURACOM</p><p>英文</p><p>Copyright 2016. EurActiv.com All Rights Reserved. </p><p></p><p>The European Union today (30 September) overcame fears over parliamentary sovereignty to secure a fast-track deal paving the way for the bloc to ratify the Paris Agreement on climate change. The deal between environment ministers at an emergency meeting will allow the EU to ratify the Paris Agreement, without every member state having previously ratified it at national level. Without it, the bloc would have missed a 7 October deadline and suffered damage to its reputation as a climate change leader. “They said Europe is too complicated to agree quickly. They said we had too many hoops to jump through. They said we were all talk,” said jubilant Climate Commissioner Miguel Arias Cañete. <a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/climate-environment/news/paris-agreement-saving-face-and-negating-trump/">https://www.euractiv.com/section/climate-environment/news/paris-agreement-saving-face-and-negating-trump/</a> “We are reaching a critical period for decisive climate action.</p><p></p><p> And when the going gets tough, Europe gets going." Slovakia, which holds the rotating Presidency of the EU, has identified 7 October as the target date for the EU to formally ratify the agreement. It called today’s extraordinary meeting of environment ministers in a desperate bid to get member states to back the fast-track deal ahead of a planned European Parliament ratification vote to be held in Strasbourg on Tuesday (4 October). The deal was secured with language stressing the European Council’s guiding role. There was further wrangling to secure language in the conclusions that stressed the fast-track deal was a one-off for the Paris Agreement and was not going over the head of national parliaments. There were further concerns that the EU ratification taking place before all governments had formally ratified the Agreement could set a precedent for other international deals, such as TTIP, the draft EU-US free trade agreement. <a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/climate-environment/news/slovakia-becomes-fourth-eu-country-to-ratify-the-paris-climate-agreement/">https://www.euractiv.com/section/climate-environment/news/slovakia-becomes-fourth-eu-country-to-ratify-the-paris-climate-agreement/</a> Poland and Italy had looked to leverage the looming deadline to win changes to the draft Effort-Sharing regulation, which sets out the share of emissions reductions each EU member state must make to a bloc-wide target. Both wanted agreement that the regulation could only become law with the unanimous backing of member states, but both backed down. Italy wanted to be able to carry over a greater share of emissions reductions from regular measuring periods to the next period than the European Commission proposal currently allows. EurActiv.com understands that such changes, after the Commission had proposed legislation, was unacceptable. Any amendments to the bill would have to be won in the Council, where it would be subject to a qualified majority vote. Landmark agreement World leaders made a landmark agreement in December last year to cap global warming to less than two degrees above pre-industrial levels. The pact enters into force 30 days after 55 countries, accounting for 55% of global emissions, formally ratify the Paris Agreement. The world’s two largest emitters, the US and China, have inked the deal, heaping pressure on the EU, a self-styled climate leader, to follow suit. India and Canada are expected to ratify next week, bringing the threshold, currently at about 48% from 61 countries, closer to 53.88%. The EU as a whole accounts for 12% of global emissions. If it does not ratify before the threshold is surpassed, it would miss out on a seat on an influential UN decision-making body shepherding the next step of the Agreement at the 7 November COP22 in Marrakech, Morocco. <a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/climate-environment/news/europe-risks-exclusion-from-key-un-climate-body/">https://www.euractiv.com/section/climate-environment/news/europe-risks-exclusion-from-key-un-climate-body/</a> Once MEPs ratify the Paris Agreement on Tuesday, the EU will be able to ratify the deal and bring the Agreement into force by taking it over the emissions threshold. While some countries such as Slovakia and France have already ratified the deal at national level, they are holding back on the formal notification to the UN so that the EU can deposit their ratification as one bloc. As last minute wrangling continued into the afternoon, Poland had said it wanted to ratify the Agreement separately to the EU. Polish diplomats held two crunch meetings with Climate Commissioner Miguel Arias Cañete before ultimately backing down. Poland could theoretically have ratified the deal on Thursday (6 September) following a vote, and submitted it to the UN at a point when its emissions share would trigger the agreement. Sources said that it was important that the EU was the body bringing the deal into force, especially as the bloc was beaten to the punch by the US and China, the first and second countries to ink the Agreement. <a href="http://www.euractiv.com/section/climate-environment/news/us-and-china-ratify-paris-climate-pact-leaving-eu-behind/">http://www.euractiv.com/section/climate-environment/news/us-and-china-ratify-paris-climate-pact-leaving-eu-behind/</a> “Our reputation was on the line,” Cañete told reporters in Brussels. If a deal had not been struck, there were concerns that France, which hosted the landmark climate conference, would ratify separately to the EU and grab the glory of being the country to trigger the Paris Agreement. While some diplomats claimed such a move would be illegal, others admitted there was nothing to stop France, which has about a 1.2% global emissions share, taking such a step. Speaking before the 9:30AM meeting, France’s Ségolène Royal said that all countries agreed with the fundamental goals of the Paris Agreement. The fact that countries had focused on details of procedure in the four hour and 15 minutes before the deal was done was a sign governments were taking the deal seriously, she told reporters this morning.&gt;</p><p></p><p>文件 EURACOM020160930ec9u0008j</p><p></p><p><img src="data:image/gif;base64,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" /></p><p></p><p><a id="toc52"></a><strong>Europe risks exclusion from key UN climate body</strong></p><p></p><p>821 字</p><p>2016 年 9 月 23 日 13:53</p><p>EurActiv.com</p><p>EURACOM</p><p>英文</p><p>Copyright 2016.

The EU was until now seen – and often decried at home – for being the undisputed leader in the global push to address climate change. But European diplomats today agree there is a real risk that the bloc will be excluded from decision-making related to the implementation of the agreement, once it comes into force. This would be a major humiliation that the vast majority of EU countries want to avoid. CMA without the EU?</p><p></p><p> In a stunt never attempted before, EU countries will make efforts to speed up the ratification of the Paris deal through national parliaments by 7 October. EU ambassadors met on Wednesday (21 September) to discuss the embarrassing situation the EU got itself into and forge the way forward.</p><p></p><p><a href="http://www.euractiv.com/section/climate-environment/news/eu-wants-to-speed-up-approval-of-paris-climate-deal/">http://www.euractiv.com/section/climate-environment/news/eu-wants-to-speed-up-approval-of-paris-climate-deal/ </a> The stakes are higher than they seem. Once the Paris deal enters into force, the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Paris Agreement, known as the CMA, will make decisions under the agreement. The CMA will formally take office at the COP22 in Marrakesh, on 7-18 November. Put simply, it will be the group responsible for supervising the Paris deal. But if EU countries don't ratify the Paris Agreement on time, it might well be founded without a European representative in it. In short, this means that countries which have ratified - including China and the US - would be making decisions on implementing the Paris Agreement that have a direct impact on Europe, without the bloc being represented. China ratification took EU by surprise As one senior EU diplomat explained, it was the ratification of the Paris deal by China that took Europe by surprise. The Paris deal on slashing greenhouse gas emissions, which has the backing of nearly 200 countries, takes effect once at least 55 nations making up at least 55% of global carbon dioxide emissions ratify it. By Wednesday the total number of ratifications had reached 60, representing more than 47.5% of emissions. Those that have ratified include China and the United States, the world’s two biggest carbon dioxide emitters. The US has strived to ratify the Paris Agreement while Barack Obama was still in office, avoiding the risk that Donald Trump, who has denied the man-made causes of climate change, comes to the Oval office. But more surprisingly for the EU, China, a “not-so-green” country, also ratified the Paris deal. <a href="http://www.euractiv.com/section/climate-environment/news/us-and-china-ratify-paris-climate-pact-leaving-eu-behind/">http://www.euractiv.com/section/climate-environment/news/us-and-china-ratify-paris-climate-pact-leaving-eu-behind/ </a> Panic This has reportedly created panic in some EU capitals, raising fears that the Paris deal could enter into force without the EU. With Japan and India coming suit soon, the EU finds itself trapped, unless it succeeds a stunt ratification by 7 October, one month before the COP 22 in Marrakesh. Only four countries have ratified so far: France, Hungary, Austria and Slovakia. <a href="http://www.euractiv.com/section/climate-environment/news/slovakia-becomes-fourth-eu-country-to-ratify-the-paris-climate-agreement/">http://www.euractiv.com/section/climate-environment/news/slovakia-becomes-fourth-eu-country-to-ratify-the-paris-climate-agreement/ </a> Plenary vote on 4 October The European Parliament has to ratify the Paris deal too, something that should happen without problem on 4 October. But some European capitals are not happy that ratification at EU level will come ahead of ratification by the national parliaments. It is expected that a Statement by the Council and the Commission would be adopted, stressing that the European Parliament vote is “sui generis” and will not constitute a precedent for future EU-decision-making.. The “usual suspect” who could derail the ratification is Poland, which wants guarantees on how the EU will share out the burden of delivering on the Paris accord before committing to ratify it. EU unable to keep its promises? European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker last week described the EU’s slow ratification of the climate deal as “ridiculous” and damaging to the bloc’s credibility. <a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/climate-environment/news/once-the-driving-force-of-climate-action-the-eu-has-fallen-behind/">https://www.euractiv.com/section/climate-environment/news/once-the-driving-force-of-climate-action-the-eu-has-fallen-behind/ </a> Although the issues are unrelated, the EU increasingly appears unable to ratify the international agreements it has concluded. This is the case of the EU-Ukraine association agreement, the ratification of which has been upset by a referendum in the Netherlands, and of CETA, the trade deal with Canada. <a href="http://www.euractiv.com/section/global-europe/news/dutch-voters-reject-eu-ukraines-association/">http://www.euractiv.com/section/global-europe/news/dutch-voters-reject-eu-ukraines-association/ </a><a href="http://www.euractiv.com/section/trade-society/news/eu-canada-summit-hangs-in-doubt-ceta-fate-uncertain/">http://www.euractiv.com/section/trade-society/news/eu-canada-summit-hangs-in-doubt-ceta-fate-uncertain/ </a>&gt;</p><p></p><p>文件 EURACOM020160923ec9n00002</p><p></p><p><img src="data:image/gif;base64,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" /></p><p></p><p><a id="toc53"></a><strong>EU wants to speed up approval of Paris climate deal</strong></p><p></p><p>553 字</p><p>2016 年 9 月 22 日 13:23</p><p>EurActiv.com</p><p>EURACOM</p><p>英文</p><p>Copyright 2016.

The EU was a prime mover behind the success of last autumn's climate talks but is now a laggard in ratifying the December deal it produced to slash greenhouse gases and keep global temperature increases to "well below" 2 degrees Celsius. The EU can only become a party to the accord if the bloc as well as each of its 28 member states deposit their ratification with the United Nations simultaneously. Slovakia, which currently holds the EU's rotating presidency, became only the fourth member state on Wednesday to ratify the accord.</p><p></p><p><a href="http://www.euractiv.com/section/climate-environment/news/slovakia-becomes-fourth-eu-country-to-ratify-the-paris-climate-agreement/">http://www.euractiv.com/section/climate-environment/news/slovakia-becomes-fourth-eu-country-to-ratify-the-paris-climate-agreement/</a> Fast-tracking EU-level approval The environment ministers will seek consensus at their September 30 meeting in Bratislava on fast-tracking EU-level approval of the deal without waiting for each member state to first ratify it, EU officials said. If they succeed, the plan would then have to be approved by the European Parliament and be signed off on by member states. The proposal could still face opposition from Poland, which wants guarantees on how the EU will share out the burden of delivering on the Paris accord before committing to ratify it. But an EU official close to the negotiations said there was a "real political will" behind the initiative. EU leaders view their leadership on the climate dossier as a rare bright spot for a bloc now battered by Britain's decision to leave the Union and by sharp divisions over migration. But European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker last week described the EU's slow ratification of the climate deal as "ridiculous" and damaging to the bloc's credibility. <a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/climate-environment/news/once-the-driving-force-of-climate-action-the-eu-has-fallen-behind/">https://www.euractiv.com/section/climate-environment/news/once-the-driving-force-of-climate-action-the-eu-has-fallen-behind/</a>EU lags China, United States Only countries which have ratified the deal have a seat at the table in drafting the rules of how it will work in practice. The Paris deal on slashing greenhouse gas emissions, which has the backing of nearly 200 countries, takes effect once at least 55 nations making up at least 55% of global carbon dioxide emissions ratify it. By Wednesday the total number of ratifications had reached 60, representing more than 47.5% of emissions. Those that have ratified include China and the United States, the world's two biggest carbon dioxide emitters. If the EU, the world's third-largest emitter, speeds up its ratification, it could win the symbolic prize of triggering the accord's formal adoption. Slovak Environment Minister Laszlo Solymos said he hoped this could be achieved by the time of UN climate talks in Marrakesh, Morocco, scheduled for November. This would allow the Europeans to "be involved in decision-making on crucial issues regarding the implementation of the agreement," he said. In the EU, France, Hungary and Austria have also ratified the accord. <a href="http://www.euractiv.com/section/climate-environment/news/us-and-china-ratify-paris-climate-pact-leaving-eu-behind/">http://www.euractiv.com/section/climate-environment/news/us-and-china-ratify-paris-climate-pact-leaving-eu-behind/</a>&gt;</p><p></p><p>文件 EURACOM020160922ec9m00006</p><p></p><p><img src="data:image/gif;base64,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" /></p><p></p><p><a id="toc54"></a><strong>Emissions trading should not be a scapegoat for steel industry</strong></p><p></p><p>980 字</p><p>2016 年 5 月 4 日 11:28</p><p>EurActiv.com</p><p>EURACOM</p><p>英文</p><p>Copyright 2016. EurActiv.com All Rights Reserved.   </p><p></p><p>Scapegoating climate protection is not only factually wrong. It will also prevent the German and European steel industry from gearing up for the future, writes Annalena Baerbock. Annalena Baerbock is the climate policy spokesperson for the Alliance 90/The Greens parliamentary group in the Bundestag. Tens of thousands of steel workers are demonstrating for the future of their jobs. And rightly so. The steel industry has come under pressure due to a massive global oversupply. Steel companies, along with the German Minister for Economic Affairs Sigmar Gabriel, were quick to find a culprit for the crisis: the European emissions trading system. The European steel industry has suffered from surplus capacities for years.</p><p></p><p> The situation has recently become increasingly dire for the sector, as the faltering economies in Russia and China have started to flood the global market with their subsidised steel at prices that are far below the manufacturing costs and impossible to compete with for European industries. The European Commission hoped to counteract this state-led distortion of competition with its recent reform of European anti-dumping instruments, but has been blocked in this area by the EU member states – including Germany – for far too long. Nevertheless, Gabriel, presumably in the hope of at least scoring a few cheap points from the steel industry, was quick to place the blame once again at the feet of the European climate protection movement. In particular, his target is emissions trading, even though the minister is well aware that this is not a viable scapegoat. After all, as an energy-intensive industry exposed to international competition, steel receives free allowances under emissions trading. For the German steel industry in particular, trading CO2 emissions allowances is a real goldmine. Between 2008 and 2012, ThyssenKrupp, ArcelorMittal and co. earned an additional €2.7 billion from oversupply and free allocations in Germany alone. According to Carbon Market Watch, European industries pocketed a windfall of at least €24 billion over 2008-2014 under the emissions trading system, with steel firms and others getting the lion’s share. Anyone now trying to sell these shady profits as a burden is playing a dishonest game, as was proved once more today when the European Court of Justice dismissed a complaint by companies claiming to be losing out from the EU ETS, when in fact the court found they are receiving too many subsidies via the ETS. The claim that this will change in future is simply false. Thanks to the oversupply of emissions allowances, there is no need for companies to make additional purchases until 2020 at the earliest. Reforms to emissions trading for the fourth trade period, starting in 2020, that are currently under discussion , which Gabriel viewed as too slow when he wasn’t busy making clumsy election campaign moves , will not change the preferential treatment received by the steel industry to a great extent. The Commission’s plans include the continuation of free allocations to industries exposed to international competition. The amount, however, is to be guided by benchmarks which take into account technological development. The argument that the threat of increased electricity prices leads to additional costs for the steel industry in Germany does not hold water. Thanks to the Energiewende, the market price of electricity for energy-intensive industry has been plummeting for years and is currently around €20 per megawatt hour. Moreover, in Germany the sector receives millions in assistance each year in the form of electricity price compensation. In 2013 these payments were around €77 million. Steel workers are rightly upset about the current situation - but the root cause lies much closer than they may know. Companies such as ThyssenKrupp have primarily suffered billions in losses due to poor investment decisions – not in Germany or Europe, but in Brazil and the US. So, before shifting the blame to an easy and incorrect target, honesty towards their employees would be a first step to set things straight. Instead of engaging in a sham battle, the German economics minister and Europe's leaders should focus on the meaning and purpose of industrial policy. This means equipping European industry for the future by promoting innovation and efficiency. The steps needed in this respect towards ultra-low carbon dioxide steelworks require benchmarks, as currently discussed in the context of emissions trading reform, just as much as a price signal that communicates how efficient management also has financial rewards. Without incentive systems such as emissions trading, innovations such as the new cyclone converter furnace, which enables significant reductions in CO2 in steel manufacturing, cannot become competitive. An end to the free allocations would thus certainly be appropriate, particularly in light of the fact that China is also introducing emissions trading. Those calling for a level playing field for competition should start looking into interlinking these systems. And please do not forget, along with every other country in the world, Europe has committed itself to keeping global warming well below two degrees Celsius. This commitment must also be recognised by the steel lobby. Last week, the EU officially signed the Paris Climate Agreement in New York. Now, at the very latest, climate policy can no longer be demonised as a programme for de-industrialisation, but needs to be viewed as a permanent fixture of our society. An example of how competitive industries are that fail to recognise this and channel their energy primarily into fighting against and thwarting climate policy goals can be found in the German car industry. Customers now camp outside Tesla showrooms when the American manufacturer’s vehicles go on sale.

Both blueprints have been filed with the UN’s civil aviation agency, Icao, ahead of talks in Montreal next month.</p><p></p><p>“The US proposal is definitely more ambitious,” said Joris Melkert, a former flight test engineer and senior aerospace lecturer at Delft University in the Netherlands. “It would save more emissions, and the difference is quite considerable.”</p><p></p><p>The gap between the two proposals is greater than the annual emissions of most medium-sized European countries, and privately confirmed by EU officials.</p><p></p><p>Aviation is responsible for around 5% of the world’s global warming at present and the industry is growing so fast that, on current trends, it could make up 22% of global emissions by 2050, according to a recent European Parliament study.</p><p></p><p>The Icao talks are pursuing a twin track approach of making airlines <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jan/13/imf-calls-for-carbon-tax-on-ships-and-planes">pay a cost for their CO2</a> output under a market-based scheme, and greening aircraft with a new fuel efficiency standard.</p><p></p><p>The debate on the standard began in 2007 and proposals agreed in Montreal will be sent on to an Icao council for approval next year. “After many years, decision time has finally come,” one EU official said. “I believe that we are going to have an ambitious standard and I hope we can secure it next month.”</p><p></p><p>&gt;&gt;Read: <a href="http://www.euractiv.com/sections/transport/eu-adopts-new-rules-better-track-aircraft-distress-320516">EU adopts new rules to better track aircraft in distress</a></p><p></p><p>Airplanes emit CO2 in the process of burning engine fuel to provide a lift force that can overcome the aerodynamic drag created by wind resistance. For this reason, the Icao proposals focus on measures to improve planes’ aerodynamics, lightness and engines.</p><p></p><p>Under the technical proposals, a stringency option of ‘9’ suggested by the US would reduce overall aircraft emissions by 37.5%, while the ‘7’ setting favoured by the EU would imply a 33% cut. The 4.5% gap is equal to 350m tonnes of CO2, or slightly more than Spain emits every year.</p><p></p><p>EU officials privately concede that their proposal is “the second most ambitious of the positions put on the table”. But they insist that it is still “quite close to the US one” and that the agreement’s small print on cargo aircraft and categorisations should not be overlooked.</p><p></p><p>Environmentalists argue that the involvement of the Environmental Protection Agency and an unshackled president Obama in the US has contributed to the relative weakness of the EU’s position.</p><p></p><p>But insiders in Brussels say that the sheer variety of complex issues still to be agreed – and the amount of aircraft manufacturing countries involved, from Brazil and Ukraine to India and China – make like-for-like comparisons unwise, and stringency factors of ‘10’ impossible.</p><p></p><p>“There are so many parameters to be decided that it creates a lot of pieces you can move around on a chessboard,” one EU source told the Guardian.</p><p></p><p>Europe has proposed a 60 tonne threshold for classifying aircraft, as this could cover 90% of emissions and apply to aircraft of the size of a Boeing 737 or Airbus 320 and above.</p><p></p><p>But the classification would be further sub-divided between new model types and those in production; jets ferrying 19 people or less, and planes carrying freight instead of passengers. Alternate starting dates of 2020 and 2023 for the benchmark are other options under discussion.</p><p></p><p>An EU source said: “We need a standard that reflects the state of art of the technology, that is as close as possible to what engineers are capable of doing, without going so high that a number of 60-tonne aircraft types would be put out of the market as that would be environmentally unhelpful, economically detrimental and also quite unfair, as lead-in times for aircraft take about 10 years.”</p><p></p><p>&gt;&gt;Read: <a href="http://www.euractiv.com/sections/transport/greening-airline-industry-314935">The greening of the airline industry</a></p><p></p><p>communication@euractiv.com   </p><p></p><p>文件 EURACOM020160122ec1m0005m</p><p></p><p><img src="data:image/gif;base64,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" /></p><p></p><p><a id="toc56"></a><strong>US demands 1.5 degree warming limit in COP21 deal</strong></p><p></p><p>1,148 字</p><p>2015 年 12 月 10 日 14:10</p><p>EurActiv.com</p><p>EURACOM</p><p>英文</p><p>Copyright 2015.

Reports had linked the US to the Coalition, which since Tuesday (7 December) has grown beyond <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/clima/news/articles/news_2015120802_en.htm">the EU nations, and 79 developing countries from the African, Caribbean and Pacific.</a></p><p></p><p>EurActiv asked Cañete on Tuesday if the 1.5 degree goal, also mentioned by Germany, was a dealbreaker for the Coalition, which has said it will only sign a truly ambitious agreement. He refused to answer.</p><p></p><p>But an EU source later insisted that the goal would be part of the final agreement, alongside the two degrees, to mark out future progress and ambition.</p><p></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/COP21?src=hash">#COP21</a> Stern. Today's text step forward but we need regular revision, we need recognition of 1.5 target in deal. — James Crisp (@JamesCrisp6) <a href="https://twitter.com/JamesCrisp6/status/674646632428892160">December 9, 2015</a></p><p></p><p>Germany’s Environment Minister, Barbara Hendricks, called for strong recognition of the 1.5 degree target in the final deal. When asked about it, Cañete said the EU was open to it but it was still under discussion.</p><p></p><p>The Commissioner said, "The draft agreement published today is not bold enough and not yet ambitious enough. I am extremely happy to see the US with us."</p><p></p><p>The Coalition of about 100 developed and developing countries could have some influence over nations less willing to sign up to a truly ambitious deal, especially now that the US, one of the world’s largest emitters, is on board.</p><p></p><p>Together, they are calling for a legally binding, fair, durable agreement in Paris that must set a long-term goal, be reviewed every five years and include a system for tracking progress.</p><p></p><p>Developments in Paris moved quickly on Wednesday, with Secretary of State John Kerry calling for a legally binding transparent system of monitoring nations' progress towards their climate commitments. He also announced a doubling of grant-based funding for developing countries.</p><p></p><p>That was followed by the publication of <a href="http://www.euractiv.com/sites/default/files/da01_1.pdf">the latest draft of the deal</a>, which was criticised by NGOs for removing international aviation and shipping from its scope.</p><p></p><p>Aviation and shipping</p><p></p><p>Cañete later told reporters that the EU was fighting to get aviation and shipping put back in, after the announcement of the expanded Coalition on Wednesday evening. He described its removal as “a step backwards”.</p><p></p><p>A previous 5 December draft had included an optional paragraph that would have singled out the two sectors and encouraged nations to curb their carbon output "with a view to agreeing concrete measures addressing these emissions". The new draft, released on Wednesday, omitted the paragraph.</p><p></p><p>While the passage would not have necessarily mandated any specific measures or regulations, it could have increased pressure for national efforts that would increase their costs.</p><p></p><p>Aviation and shipping make up around 5% of global emissions but their contribution is predicted to grow significantly if left unchecked. The European Commission estimates that air and marine transportation could contribute as much as a third of all emissions by 2050.</p><p></p><p>"The dropping of international aviation and shipping emissions from the draft Paris climate agreement ... has fatally undermined the prospects of keeping global warming below 2°C," green groups Seas At Risk and Transport &amp; Environment (T&amp;E) said in a joint statement. Climate Action Network Europe echoed those fears.</p><p></p><p>After the new draft was published, civil society organisations, later staged an unofficial sit-in protest in a main hall, chanting “1.5 to stay alive”, and “climate justice”.</p><p></p><p>NGOs must ask for permission and abide by certain conditions, such as not naming individual countries, for their ‘actions’. Organisers said 500 people were involved.</p><p></p><p>“The EU came to Paris for a fair, ambitious deal, but there is a real risk that it’s going to be responsible for an unfair, unjust outcome. With critical issues on finance, human rights, and support for the most vulnerable still to be fought over, the EU must step up and do its fair share so that the Paris deal doesn’t turn into a raw deal for the poorest,” said Susann Scherbarth, climate justice and energy campaigner at Friends of the Earth Europe, one of the organisers.</p><p></p><p>Discussing the EU announcement of the ‘high ambition coalition’ of over 100 countries including the US, Mexico and many developing countries, she added, "The EU can’t hide behind alliances – it must commit to its fair share of emissions cuts and finance.”</p><p></p><p>The protest was sparked by the latest draft of the deal, which still left major sticking points between the almost 200 countries represented at COP21 unresolved.</p><p></p><p>Foremost among them is who shoulders the cost of moving the world to a low-carbon energy system and how often nations should be prompted to accelerate their efforts.</p><p></p><p>"On these issues I ask you to scale up your consultations to speedily come to compromise solutions," Laurent Fabius, president of the COP21, said, addressing the conference.</p><p></p><p>He said the new draft text was 29 pages long, against 43 on Saturday, and three-quarters of the points of dispute had been settled.</p><p></p><p>&gt;&gt;Read: <a href="http://www.euractiv.com/sections/climate-environment/new-clean-cop21-deal-due-today-deadline-looms-320242">New ‘clean’ COP21 deal due today as deadline looms</a></p><p></p><p>Developing countries are demanding that rich governments be obliged to scale up climate finance from the $100 billion a year already promised beginning in 2020.</p><p></p><p>Wealthier countries balk at language that would leave them legally bound to do so.

The French government wants to use the latest IPCC report as the basis for a political agreement at the Paris Climate conference in 2015. <a href="http://www.euractiv.fr/sections/developpement-durable/rajendra-pachauri-salue-les-efforts-de-lue-sur-le-climat-309826">EurActiv.fr reports</a>.</p><p></p><p>The IPCC President, Rajendra Pachauri, praised the EU for its 2030 climate objectives, whilst appealing to the world to act on climate issues in Paris on Wednesday 5 November.</p><p></p><p>The scientist presented the findings of the <a href="http://www.climatechange2013.org/">5th IPCC report</a> at a meeting with the French Minister for the Environment, Ségolène Royal, and Foreign Affairs Minister, Laurent Fabius.</p><p></p><p>The report presents new findings on the climate, and the human impact on global warming.</p><p></p><p>"We are 95% certain that mankind is responsible for the increase in air and sea temperatures," Rajendra Pachauri said, citing one of the discoveries of this latest report: the oceans have absorbed most of the extra heat that has been observed over the last 10 years, leading to a general rise in water temperatures.</p><p></p><p>&gt;&gt; Read:<a href="http://www.euractiv.com/sections/sustainable-dev/countries-reluctant-deal-climate-change-301288"> Countries reluctant to deal with climate change</a></p><p></p><p>This observation is both undeniable and "good news", according to Pachauri. We still have time to build a stable and prosperous future, if we manage to reduce carbon emissions. But it will not be easy. In order to limit the global temperature rise to +2 degrees, CO2 emissions must be cut by 40 to 70% between 2010 and 2050, and the world will have to become carbon neutral by the year 2100. This scenario will be unattainable without an enormous joint effort.</p><p></p><p>Top marks for the EU</p><p></p><p>In an interview with EurActiv.fr, the IPCC chief welcomed the EU's target of reducing CO2 emissions by 40% by 2030, without criticising the fact that energy efficiency had been relegated to second place.</p><p></p><p>"It is up to individual governments and citizens to decide how they will achieve this. Energy efficiency is a solution that our societies must grasp. That applies to the EU and other countries around the world," the scientist said. He was not forthcoming on the concrete solutions adopted by the EU for combatting climate change.</p><p></p><p>"The European Emissions Trading Scheme is an interesting experiment. I cannot say whether it has been a success or a failure, but the important thing is that the world has learned from the experience," Pachauri added, taking pains to remain diplomatic.</p><p></p><p>A reference report for Paris Climate 2015</p><p></p><p>Laurent Fabius, the French Minister for Foreign Affairs, believes the report should be taken as the basis for an international agreement at the Paris Climate Conference in 2015.</p><p></p><p>"The IPCC report tells us three very simple, very important things: climate-scepticism is impossible; climate-fatalism is dangerous; and willingness to act is crucial," the Minister said.</p><p></p><p>Laurent Fabius revealed the four domains on which France hopes the Paris climate agreement will focus:</p><p></p><p>1 - A legally-binding protocol aimed at limiting the global temperature rise to +2 degrees Celsius by 2050;</p><p></p><p>2 – A detailed plan of how each country plans to modify its economic model;</p><p></p><p>3 - The transfer of funds from North to South through the Green Climate Fund;</p><p></p><p>4 - Solutions proposed by civil society, local communities and businesses.</p><p></p><p>&gt;&gt; Read:<a href="http://www.euractiv.com/sections/energy/additional-eu20bn-year-needed-french-energy-transition-309409"> Additional €20bn per year needed for French energy transition</a></p><p></p><p>Trial run in Lima</p><p></p><p>"The COP in Lima is an opportunity to create a first draft of the Paris agreement, and to advance the discussions on the commitments the different countries will make," the Minister added.</p><p></p><p>The nature of the commitments will be at the centre of the debate. Some countries, such as China, have preferred to make commitments tied to the growth of their GDP and their population, rather than in absolute values, which makes comparisons complicated. The audit and verification mechanisms for CO2 emissions are also an extremely sensitive subject.</p><p></p><p>Despite the obstacles, Laurent Fabius believes in the possibility of a political agreement.</p><p></p><p>"China is now in favour of an agreement .... In the USA, we think that Obama is truly committed to these issues and that an agreement will be an important asset for his presidency, whichever party has the majority on the Senate," he said, referring to the future Republican majority in the USA's upper chamber.</p><p></p><p>Rajendra Pachauri wished the negotiators "good luck" in coming to an agreement.</p><p></p><p>European Parliament resolution calls for an agreement</p><p></p><p>The European Parliament adopted a <a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/news-room/content/20141104IPR77230/html/Climate-change-talks-MEPs-chart-the-course-from-Lima-to-Paris">resolution</a> on the road from Lima to Paris on 5 November.</p><p></p><p>"Our ultimate goal is to put our economies on track for a sub-2°C climate warming scenario. In Lima next month, UNFCCC parties are to work constructively to develop elements of the agreement to be concluded in Paris, and we should play a key role," said Environment Committee chair Giovanni La Via.</p><p></p><p>MEPs reiterated the EU's promise to capitalise the UN's Green Climate Fund, and to mobilise 100 billion dollars by 2020. The Fund has so far only raised 2.3 billion dollars.</p><p></p><p>communication@euractiv.com   </p><p></p><p>文件 EURACOM020141126eab7000j3</p><p></p><p><img src="data:image/gif;base64,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" /></p><p></p><p><a id="toc58"></a><strong>Prakash Mathema: Poorest countries have the most to lose at UN climate talks</strong></p><p></p><p>1,834 字</p><p>2014 年 10 月 21 日 15:57</p><p>EurActiv.com</p><p>EURACOM</p><p>英文</p><p>Copyright 2014. EurActiv.com All Rights Reserved.   </p><p></p><p>Nepal's Prakash Mathema is leading the UN climate change negotiations for the group of Least Developed Countries Group (LDC). According to him, an ambitious outcome at the 2015 Paris UN summit can only be reached if vulnerability to climate change impacts of poorest countries are taken into consideration.</p><p></p><p>Prakash Mathema is joint secretary at Nepal's Ministry of Science, Technology &amp; Environment. He chairs the Least Developed Countries Group at the UN climate change negotiations. The LDC group represent 48 nations that are especially vulnerable to climate change but have done little to cause the problem, and will benefit from the Green Climate Fund.</p><p></p><p>You are the chair of the Least Developed Countries Group at UN climate change negotiations. What are the challenges and expectations of LDC Group regarding the negotiation process?</p><p></p><p>The ultimate goal for the LDC Group is to ensure that the voices, needs and priorities of the world’s most vulnerable people are heard and addressed. Climate change affects us all, but the negative impacts are felt hardest by the poorest, because they typically live in more dangerous locations, have fewer assets, skills and access to basic services to cope with impacts caused by climate change. If the global response to climate change does not give adequate attention to the circumstances and needs of the most vulnerable, then it cannot be equitable.</p><p></p><p>To represent the voiceless is a difficult task in itself, and in the negotiations process, the LDC Group has its own particular challenges in addition to this. Our countries’ delegations are much smaller than those of our wealthier counterparts. When our delegations come to climate change talks, we are supposed to follow all the agenda items between us – compared to other groups who may have one person following one or two items, or sometimes a small team following a single major item, like climate finance or adaptation.</p><p></p><p>We try to overcome this lack of capacity by strengthening coordination within the LDC Group, and we have developed a strategy for engagement over these past years. Negotiations are always difficult but I have confidence in my Group – all the negotiators are extremely committed, especially because we all know our countries have the most to lose if we fail to engage in the process as much as possible.</p><p></p><p>Leading up to Paris, the numbers of negotiating days are dwindling and we expect that substantial progress must therefore be made in the short time available to ensure that an ambitious and fair outcome for all can be reached in Paris. Vulnerability of our countries should be the benchmark for setting commitments in the new climate agreement because success in addressing climate change at global level will not be achieved unless the key concerns of those that are extremely vulnerability to climate change impacts are appropriately taken into consideration.</p><p></p><p>The UN Climate Summit was held last month in New York. As chair of Least Developed Countries Group at UN climate change negotiations, did you feel that your group was listened to during this event?</p><p></p><p>The UN Climate Summit was a timely opportunity for world leaders to lay out their action plans and make bold pledges detailing what more they can do to combat climate change. In December, climate change negotiators will reconvene in Lima to continue work on the new climate treaty, which is to be adopted in Paris, in December 2015.</p><p></p><p>At the UN Summit, more than 20 LDCs spoke of their plans to undertake ambitious action involving low carbon climate resilient development and the sequestration of carbon through enhancement of forest cover. To give two specific examples, the prime minister of Ethiopia pledged to achieve a green climate resilient economy with zero net emissions by 2025; and the prime minister of Tuvalu announced his commitment to employ 100% renewable energy in electricity supply by 2020. These ambitious pledges sent a powerful message about what is possible. Even with the limited economic capacity and extreme vulnerability of our nations, the LDCs are leading the way to a low carbon future. We expect others to scale up ambition and leadership on climate change in more strongly than the LDCs.</p><p></p><p>COP 21 will be held in France in 2015. What do you think of the French position on LDC needs to fight climate change?</p><p></p><p>We have noticed that French diplomacy is already engaged in ensuring a successful outcome in Paris in 2015. The French government has been making efforts to ensure that Paris marks an important step in history of climate change negotiations. President Hollande pledged US $1 billion (€780 million) to the Green Climate Fund at the New York Summit. In addition to this, France is making necessary efforts to ensure a positive climate finance outcome in Lima. However, more efforts are needed for securing high mitigation ambition to fully demonstrate the French government's commitment to addressing climate change. Paris should deliver an agreement that protects the future of the most vulnerable countries. We have full confidence in France’s leadership in getting an ambitious outcome in Paris that will limit the global average temperature rise below 1.5oC relative to pre-industrial level by the end of the century that addresses the needs of most vulnerable countries.</p><p></p><p>Developing countries such as China or India haven’t committed yet on how they will participate. What do you expect from these countries?</p><p></p><p>Countries like China, India and other rapidly emerging economies represent important voices in the climate change negotiations. We are encouraged by some positive signals from their governments in recent months, including China’s aim to submit its contributions to the Paris Agreement by June 2015, as well as some developments around a potential cap in China's emissions in near future. These developments continue to send clear message to other major players in the negotiations, in particular industrialised economies, to scale up their ambition and put forward bold contributions.</p><p></p><p>One of the biggest things at stake in the negotiations is that developed countries mobilise money to effectively start the Green Climate Fund. Now, only France and Germany have made significant announcement ($1 billion each) but major countries like the UK or USA haven’t announced anything yet. Are you satisfied with the general commitment on Green Climate Fund and what do you expect from this financing tool?</p><p></p><p>The LDCs are encouraged by the separate pledges of $1 billion each made by Germany and France to the Green Climate Fund’s initial capitalisation in July and at September's UN Climate Summit, respectively. The leadership shown by developing nations like Mexico and Korea are also encouraging. Pledges like these will help ensure that vulnerable countries like the LDCs have the means to adapt to climate change. This will also build trust in the negotiations for the 2015 agreement.</p><p></p><p>The LDCs hope that other countries will continue to pledge in order to meet the November deadline for the initial resource mobilisation of the Green Climate Fund. Thus far, pledges to the Fund have amounted to only $2.3 billion only. This total falls far short of the Fund’s goal of raising $10–15 billion (€7.8 billion to €11.7 billion) by next month. The LDCs look forward to other countries joining Germany, France and others as contributors to the Green Climate Fund.</p><p></p><p>European Union is holding a summit on 23 and 24 of October to take a decision on 2030 climate goals and discuss of a common position for Paris Climate Agreement 2015. What do you expect from the EU?</p><p></p><p>We are confident that the EU will show renewed leadership on climate action both domestically and internationally. The LDCs look forward to the European Commission adopting its 2030 framework for climate and energy policy, which includes commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase the share of renewables in the total energy mix.</p><p></p><p>In 2011, it was the LDC’s alliance with AOSIS and the EU, which broke through the gridlocked negotiations and put the world on the pathway to agree on a new treaty in 2015. The LDCs hope the EU will join us in continuing this spirit of leadership.</p><p></p><p>The EU will not participate in the first capitalisation of Green Climate Fund. What message is this sending to the LDC Group?</p><p></p><p>We are confident that EU member states will contribute individually to the Fund. So far, Germany and France are the countries that have pledged the highest amount to the Green Climate Fund. Denmark, Luxembourg and the Czech Republic were also among the few countries to announce contributions to the Green Climate Fund in New York. However, we are still very far from attaining the $100 billion (€78 billion) per year by 2020 mark, but the small amount that has been capitalised thus far is largely the result of the leadership of EU member states. We welcome this but urge others, within and outside the EU, to pledge and also scale up their pledges.</p><p></p><p>There is a lot of discussion on how climate action should be financed for LDCs, including proposal like putting a global price on carbon and climate bonds. Which tools would have the support of LDCs?</p><p></p><p>For the LDCs, it is important, that financial flows, especially for adaptation, come in the form of grants, not loans, and that they should come mainly from public sources. Our group is trying to understand the implications of the proposals to put a global price or tax on carbon, and to issue green bonds or climate bonds in particular to increase private sector participation in mobilising climate funds.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the LDCs proposed the establishment of an International Air Passenger Adaptation Levy in 2008, which would charge a small levy to passengers of international flights (differentiated by class of travel). This would raise between $8 and 10 billion annually. This amount will increase in the long-term, and would truly be new, additional, and predictable climate finance. We hope this proposal can gain ground again as we double up international efforts to significantly increase climate finance.</p><p></p><p>Most climate funding promises to the LDCs made at the Copenhagen Summit in 2009 were not kept. Do you feel confident that this time it will be different?</p><p></p><p>It was in Copenhagen that developed nations committed to a goal of jointly mobilising $100 billion a year by 2020 to address the needs of developing countries. The LDCs see Lima as the place where climate finance will be delivered with clarity on the post Fast Start Finance efforts for climate finance mobilisation. In Lima, we hope to witness bold financial pledges to the main funds that support financing of the climate actions of LDCs: the Least Developed Countries Fund (LDCF), the Adaptation Fund, and the Green Climate Fund. Lima is the place for developed countries to scale up finance in a way that demonstrates their resolve to fulfill their commitment of providing $100 billion per year by 2020.</p><p></p><p>communication@euractiv.com   </p><p></p><p>文件 EURACOM020141126eaal000cd</p><p></p><p><strong>搜索摘要</strong></p><p></p><table><tr><td><p> 文字</p></td><td><p>Paris Climate Agreement AND China</p></td></tr><tr><td><p> 日期</p></td><td><p>15/11/2012 至 30/09/2019</p></td></tr><tr><td><p> 资讯来源</p></td><td><p>EurActiv.com</p></td></tr><tr><td><p> 作者</p></td><td><p>所有作者</p></td></tr><tr><td><p> 公司</p></td><td><p>所有公司</p></td></tr><tr><td><p> 新闻主题</p></td><td><p>所有新闻主题</p></td></tr><tr><td><p> 行业</p></td><td><p>所有行业</p></td></tr><tr><td><p> 地区</p></td><td><p>所有地区</p></td></tr><tr><td><p> 语言</p></td><td><p>英文</p></td></tr><tr><td><p> 搜索结果已找到</p></td><td><p>68</p></td></tr><tr><td><p> 时间戳记</p></td><td><p>2020 年 12 月 3 日 9:32</p></td></tr></table><p></p>`;

日</p><p>The New York Times</p><p>NYTF</p><p>The International Herald Tribune</p><p>英文</p><p>Copyright 2012 The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved. </p><p></p><p>BEIJING -- The 18th National Congress of the <strong>Chinese Communist Party</strong> was ''a very big event'' even by the standards of the world's biggest political party and second-largest economy, many senior party members and government researchers say.</p><p></p><p>Big not just in the obvious sense that the congress was tasked with choosing the new party leaders, who will also become the leaders of the government, something that usually happens only once every 10 years.</p><p></p><p>But big also for a significant, potentially perilous, quality that distinguished this congress from its predecessors (including the first, at the party's founding, in Shanghai in 1921): China has moved beyond the era of the strongman, a man whose words count above all others'.</p><p></p><p>Instead, several thousand members of prominent political and military families and their allies battled for influence over promotions at the top, making the road to the congress ''extremely chaotic,'' said a senior party researcher, who insisted on anonymity because of the sensitivity of the subject.</p><p></p><p>Although the last true strongman, Deng Xiaoping, died in 1997, others with influence lingered, including one of the political elders known as the ''Eight Immortals'': Bo Yibo, who died in 2007. Even Deng's long shadow has taken time to fade, but by now, the researcher said, China is deep into a new, less certain era of ''palace politics,'' the sort of highly personalized power plays that characterized many imperial dynasties.</p><p></p><p>''China's current problem is that it has no strongman, and no democratic decision-making system,'' either of which could confer legitimacy, said the researcher, whose specialty is Communist Party history.</p><p></p><p>''We've lost our rules,'' he said. ''Decision by strongman is one set of rules. And democracy is, too. But today we have neither.''</p><p></p><p>That makes it sound like China is somewhat rudderless, which is not correct, either. It has what many people here and some abroad consider a good choice for party leader and state president -- Xi Jinping, the son of a revolutionary leader, Xi Zhongxun.</p><p></p><p>Yet it was perhaps a hand from the grave that pointed the way ahead.</p><p></p><p>In a sign of how long-term planning can be here, in politics as well as economics, Mr. Xi, 59, was tapped early on as a leader, as long as 20 years ago, by his father, but also by none other than Mr. Deng.</p><p></p><p>''Deng played a very long game, like in chess,'' said the researcher.</p><p></p><p>In between, the road was carefully chosen, too. Mr. Deng was influential in picking Hu Jintao, 69, the current president, ''as a way to cut off Jiang Zemin,'' Mr. Hu's 86-year-old predecessor, whose high-profile presence at this congress irritated some party insiders who wish he would withdraw from the scene. But China honors such elders, complicating the issue.</p><p></p><p>''Deng didn't trust Jiang, and Hu's main advantage was that he was young,'' so could outlive Mr. Jiang, the researcher said, ''even though Mr. Hu wasn't considered all that capable.''</p><p></p><p>The strongman runs deep in the psyche of the Communist Party.</p><p></p><p>''From the first congress until the era of Deng Xiaoping, at every congress there was a powerful core, either an individual like Mao Zedong,'' the researcher said, ''or the Moscow Comintern,'' which helped organize the <strong>Chinese Communist Party</strong> and choose leaders into the 1930s.</p><p></p><p>When the Communist forces regrouped in the northern province of Shaanxi, from where they would take over the country in 1949, ''Mao began to choose,'' he said. ''After Mao died, most personnel decisions were made by Deng, though even he could not decide alone.''</p><p></p><p>In 1989, in the crisis set off by the Tiananmen Square protests, Li Xiannian and Chen Yun, two other ''immortals,'' had a say in selecting top leaders, too. ''That was a very complicated time,'' he added. ''Now all those political strongmen are gone.''</p><p></p><p>Jiang Zemin was the transitional figure. ''And today, no one person can choose,'' he said. ''We are at a stage of groping for a system to select the power holders.''</p><p></p><p>All that makes the selection of the next, or sixth, generation of Chinese Communist leaders an issue to attend to early, with kingmakers eager to identify candidates and strengthen their authority to smooth the next power transfer, set for 2022. Whatever the future leaders lack in legitimacy must be made up in personal clout.</p><p></p><p>Already some names are being widely bandied, such as Zhou Qiang, 52, the party secretary of Hunan Province, and Hu Chunhua, 49, the party secretary of Inner Mongolia. Whether these men will rise to the very top is unclear, but at a recent meeting of the party delegation from Hunan Province, Mr. Zhou showed the kind of diplomacy and authority that may work well for him.</p><p></p><p>As the octogenarian Xiong Qingquan, a former Hunan party secretary, spoke ramblingly to delegates and reporters, the delegates began to smile in embarrassment. Their smiles deepened as Mr. Xiong whipped out a large sample of his calligraphy to show everyone. Mr. Zhou stepped in.</p><p></p><p>''Secretary Xiong is an old delegate. His ideas are good; his calligraphy is good, too,'' he said, moving the action back to proceedings while preserving Mr. Xiong's face.</p><p></p><p>文件 NYTF000020121115e8bf00069</p><p></p>`;
